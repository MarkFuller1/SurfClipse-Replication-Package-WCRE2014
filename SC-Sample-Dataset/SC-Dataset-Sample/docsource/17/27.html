PREREQUISITES:<br /> <br /> Before installing Fix Pack 006, you must have one of the following software already installed on the system:<br /> <br /> • Tivoli Application Dependency Discovery Manager v7.2.0<br /> • Tivoli Application Dependency Discovery Manager v7.2.0 + FP1<br /> • Tivoli Application Dependency Discovery Manager v7.2.0 + FP2<br /> • Tivoli Application Dependency Discovery Manager v7.2.0 + FP3<br /> • Tivoli Application Dependency Discovery Manager v7.2.0 + FP4<br /> • Tivoli Application Dependency Discovery Manager v7.2.0 + FP5<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 3.0. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:<br /> <br /> Upgrading to version 7.2.0 FP6<br /> <br /> Before upgrading Tivoli Application Dependency Discovery Manager (TADDM), check to ensure that your computing environment meets the requirements for each of the principal components of TADDM.<br /> <br /> <br /> 3.0.1. PERFORMING PREREQUISITE TASKS<br /> <br /> <b>*************************************NOTE***************************************</b><br /> <b>Please note if you have not already applied 7.2 FP2 then the following will affect you.</b><br /> <br /> <b>Fix Pack 002 incorporates new functionality to prepare for a future zVM DLA. As part of this change, the Fix Pack guid migration step will be deleting all ZVMGuests created by the Linux Sensor. This is required to ensure no duplicates are created post Fix Pack 002. IDML loaded zVMGuest objects are not affected, only discovered objects of this type and any children. These objects will need to be re-discovered after upgrade. Please plan the upgrade accordingly to ensure these deletes are non-disruptive.</b><br /> <b>********************************************************************************</b><br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 1. If the TADDM server is running, please stop the TADDM server before applying this fix pack. On<br /> Windows use the stopserver command(not control stop) to stop TADDM.<br /> <br /> <br /> 2. Use one of the following procedures to ensure all TADDM Server Java processes are stopped:<br /> <br /> - For Linux, Solaris, AIX, and Linux on System z operating systems, complete the following<br /> steps:<br /> a. Go to the %TADDM_HOME%/dist/bin directory.<br /> b. Enter the following command: ./control stop<br /> c. If all of the Java processes have not stopped after entering the ./control stop command<br /> and waiting an appropriate amount of time for the processes to shut down, use the<br /> process ID information provided by the ps command to identify and stop the running<br /> Java processes related to TADDM: ps -ef | grep java<br /> <br /> - For Window systems, use the Windows Task Manager to ensure that all TADDM Server Java<br /> processes are stopped (Including jservice.exe processes). Also please note that other non-<br /> TADDM services may run jservice.exe processes, these will also need to be stopped.<br /> <br /> <br /> 3. Create a backup of the database. To create a backup of a DB2 database, complete the <br /> following steps:<br /> <br /> a. Use one of the following procedures:<br /> <br /> - For Linux, Solaris, AIX, and Linux on System z operating systems, log in as the DB2 <br /> database instance owner. For example, you can use the db2inst1 ID.<br /> <br /> - For Windows operating systems, open the DB2CMD command prompt.<br /> <br /> b. Run the following command: <br /> db2 backup database cmdb <br /> <br /> Replace cmdb with the name of your database.<br /> <br /> If you use an Oracle database, refer to the Oracle documentation for instructions about how to <br /> backup the database.<br /> <br /> 4. Create a complete backup of the server files. Depending on the operating system, use the<br /> tar command to compress the entire directory. For Linux, Solaris, AIX, and Linux on System z <br /> operating systems, you want to use the tar command on the /opt/IBM/cmdb directory. For <br /> Windows operating systems, you want to use the zip command on the C:\ibm\cmdb directory.<br /> <br /> <br /> 5. (Optional) If you made changes to any of these files, save a copy of them: <br /> cmdb-context.xml file (ecmdb-context.xml if an enterprise TADDM)<br /> etc/EventConfig.xml <br /> etc/discover-sensors/*<br /> etc/sync/* <br /> etc/omnibus.eif.properties<br /> <br /> After the upgrade process is complete, you need to merge the contents of these backup files <br /> with the contents of the newly installed versions before starting the server.<br /> <br /> <br /> 6. For Windows systems please note the TADDM installer uses the TADDM Service to control<br /> the TADDM status, ensure TADDM is runnable as a service otherwise the installation may fail<br /> with:<br /> <br /> CTJT10203E The GUID migration fails because the Tivoli Application Dependency Discovery<br /> Manager Server did not start within a specified time...<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 3.0.2. UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS<br /> <br /> <b> *************************************NOTE*****************************************************</b><br /> <b> Please note unzipping the fixpack zip file can fail if the file is over 2GB in size. This is</b><br /> <b> a known zip bug and in order to resolve it Zip Ver 6 or higher needs to be installed.</b><br /> <br /> <b> Latest sources and executables are at </b><b><u><a href="http://www.info-zip.org">http://www.info-zip.org</a></u></b><br /> <b> *************************************************************************************************</b><br /> <br /> Before beginning the upgrade, verify that your system is running a supported operating system and<br /> that all hardware and software requirements are met. <br /> <br /> Also, if you use a TADDM Enterprise Domain Server, upgrade your TADDM Enterprise Domain <br /> Server before upgrading the TADDM Domain Server. You must upgrade the TADDM Enterprise <br /> Domain Server and all TADDM Domain Servers at the same time. You can use the following <br /> instructions to upgrade both the TADDM Domain Server and the TADDM Enterprise Domain <br /> Server.<br /> <br /> <br /> *** Please make sure that TADDM is stopped before starting this upgrade ***<br /> <br /> <br /> To upgrade the TADDM Server, complete the following steps:<br /> <br /> 1. Change to the TADDM Fix Pack directory<br /> <br /> 2. Use one of the following commands to run the upgrade process, replacing 'taddm_dir' with <br /> your TADDM directory and do not include dist in the path(example taddm_dir; /opt/IBM/cmdb):<br /> <br /> - For Linux, Solaris, AIX, and Linux on System z operating systems:<br /> <br /> To run the fix pack installation in GUI mode, type: <br /> ./installFixPack.sh taddm_dir<br /> <br /> To run the fix pack installation in console mode, type: <br /> ./installFixPack.sh taddm_dir -i CONSOLE<br /> <br /> To run the fix pack installation in silent mode, type:<br /> ./installFixPack.sh taddm_dir -i SILENT<br /> <br /> Please note in Silent mode information and error messages are not displayed on screen so <br /> after the install you must review the migration logs for errors.<br /> <br /> - For Windows operating systems:<br /> <br /> To run the fix pack installation in GUI mode, type:<br /> installFixPack.bat taddm_dir<br /> <br /> To run the fix pack installation in console mode, type:<br /> installFixPack.bat taddm_dir -i CONSOLE<br /> <br /> To run the fix pack installation in silent mode, type:<br /> installFixPack.bat taddm_dir -i SILENT<br /> <br /> Please note in Silent mode information and error messages are not displayed on screen so <br /> after the install you must review the migration logs for errors.<br /> <br /> 3. If the specified TADDM directory is version 7.2 , the installer prompts you for the upgrade. Click <br /> Next to proceed.<br /> <br /> 4. After the upgrade process is complete, a page indicating the status of the upgrade is displayed.<br /> Click Finish to close the upgrade program.<br /> <br /> 5. If you saved a backup copy of any files in step 5 (the &quot;Performing prerequisite tasks&quot; section),<br /> merge the contents of the backup copy with the contents of the new file that is installed as a <br /> part of the upgrade.<br /> <br /> If an error occurs during the upgrade, you can correct the problem and restart the TADDM <br /> installation process. The installation process resumes the upgrade process; you do not <br /> have to repeat any steps that were successfully completed.<br /> <br /> In the event the database upgrade fails after it is initialized, the database may need to be <br /> restored before resuming the upgrade. Contact Support if database upgrade problems are <br /> encountered.<br /> <br /> Locating Log Files<br /> The fix pack installer creates several log files in the installLogs directory during the upgrade:<br /> <br /> - Main log files:<br /> installLogs/taddm_7.2.0.6_install.log<br /> installLogs/taddm_7.2.0.6_install_msg.log<br /> <br /> - DB upgrade log files:<br /> dist/log/migration.log<br /> <br /> <br /> 6. Clearing the Java Web Start cache, after you install the server, you might have to clear the <br /> Java Web Start cache on each client system where you log in to the Product Console.<br /> <br /> To clear the Java Web Start cache, complete the following steps: <br /> <br /> a. Go to the directory where Java 1.5 is installed. <br /> <br /> b. Change to the \jre\bin directory.<br /> <br /> c. Double-click javaws.exe. <br /> 1. In the Java Application Cache Viewer window, click Edit &gt; Preferences. <br /> 2. In the Java Control panel, under the Temporary Internet Files section, click Delete Files, <br /> select all check boxes, and click OK.<br /> 3. Click OK.<br /> <br /> Also Domain Manager Users should clear their browser cache if they experience issues after<br /> installing the FP such as blank screens.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 7. If integrating TADDM with TBSM, CCMDB, or any other third party product please be sure to <br /> copy the necessary client jars to those installations. If ZVMGuests discovered by the Linux<br /> sensor existed in the database prior to the Fix Pack 006 upgrade, re-discover them and <br /> re-run any necessary integration scripts to ensure the changes are pulled into the third party<br /> product. The deletes and re-discovery of the ZVMGuests will be logged in change history.<br /> <br /> If TADDM-ITM integration (MOSWOS) is already installed on TADDM server, <br /> then the Customer needs to uninstall it and install it again after upgrading to 7.2<br /> <br /> Configuring ITM Scope Sensor for Fix Pack 6<br /> <br /> If you want to use ITM Scope Sensor with TADDM 7.2.0 you have to carry out following steps, due to changes in discovery target support bundle and custom queries SQL files. Now it is necessary to deploy KD7 bundle only to Windows discovery targets. Users must redeploy the latest KD7 bundle to all Windows endpoints. The KD7 bundle is no longer required on Unix targets. The KD7 bundle need not be removed from Unix targets.<br /> <br /> Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is no longer required on each ITM endpoint to be discovered. Target machine requirements are now:<br /> <br /> 1. Windows discovery targets must have Microsoft .Net Framework 1.1 or later installed.<br /> 2 .Linux and UNIX systems must have a Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) compliant uuencode and uudecode commands installed.<br /> <br /> <br /> Distributing the discovery target support bundle<br /> <br /> Before the first discovery from TADDM, the discovery target support bundle must be deployed onto each Tivoli Monitoring endpoint that is Windows operating system. <br /> <br /> <b> </b>Note: The discovery target support bundle has changed in Fix Pack 6 and should be redeployed to all Windows monitoring endpoints.<br /> <br /> The support bundle is in the KD7.zip or KD7_621.zip file in the /itm-discovery-support directory.<br /> The KD7.zip file should be used for the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server Version 6.2.2 FP2 or higher. The KD7_621.zip file should be used for the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server Version 6.2.1 FP1 or higher. <br /> <br /> To distribute the support bundle to the discovery targets, complete the following steps:<br /> <br /> 1. Extract the appropriate KD7.zip file into a directory on the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server (for example, the C:\TEMP directory on Windows and /tmp on Linux&reg; or UNIX&reg; system).<br /> 2. To distribute the support bundle to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server depot, run the tacmd command as user administrator, as shown in the following sample. To suppress the confirmation, use the -f option. <br /> <br /> On Windows operating system:<br /> <br /> C:\IBM\ITM\bin&gt;tacmd login -u sysadmin -p mypassword -s localhost<br /> <br /> Validating user...<br /> <br /> KUIC00007I: User sysadmin logged into server on <a href="https://localhost:3102">https://localhost:3102</a>.<br /> C:\IBM\ITM\bin&gt;tacmd addBundles -i C:\TEMP\KD7\072006000<br /> <br /> KUICAB023I: Are you sure you want to add the following bundles<br /> to the C:\IBM\ITM\CMS\depot\ depot?<br /> <br /> Product Code : D7<br /> Version : 072006000<br /> Description : TADDM Discovery through ITM enablement<br /> Host Type : WINNT<br /> Host Version : WINNT<br /> Prerequisites:<br /> <br /> KUICAB024I: Enter Y for yes or N for no: y<br /> <br /> KUICAB020I: Adding bundles to the C:\IBM\ITM\CMS\depot\ depot. <br /> The time required to complete this operation depends on the<br /> number and size of the added bundles.<br /> <br /> KUICAB022I: The following bundles were successfully added to the C:\IBM\ITM\CMS<br /> <br /> <br /> On Linux or UNIX operating system:<br /> <br /> [root@localhost bin]# /opt/IBM/ITM/bin/tacmd login -s localhost -u sysadmin -p &quot;teppass1&quot;<br /> <br /> Validating user...<br /> <br /> KUIC00007I: User sysadmin logged into server on <a href="https://localhost:3661">https://localhost:3661</a>.<br /> [root@localhost bin]# /opt/IBM/ITM/bin/tacmd addBundles -i /tmp/KD7/072006000/<br /> <br /> KUICAB023I: Are you sure you want to add the following bundles <br /> to the /opt/IBM/ITM/tables/TEMS/depot depot?<br /> <br /> Product Code : D7<br /> Version : 072006000<br /> Description : TADDM Discovery through ITM enablement<br /> Host Type : WINNT<br /> Host Version : WINNT<br /> Prerequisites:<br /> <br /> KUICAB024I: Enter Y for yes or N for no: y<br /> <br /> KUICAB020I: Adding bundles to the /opt/IBM/ITM/tables/TEMS/depot depot.<br /> The time required to complete this operation depends on the number and size<br /> of the added bundles.<br /> <br /> KUICAB022I: The following bundles were successfully added to the<br /> /opt/IBM/ITM/tables/TEMS/depot depot:<br /> <br /> 3. To distribute the support bundle from the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server to the discovery targets, log in to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server, and run the tacmd command, as shown in the following sample:<br /> <br /> tacmd login -u sysadmin -p mypassword -s localhost<br /> Validating user...<br /> KUIC00007I: User sysadmin logged into server on <a href="https://localhost:3102">https://localhost:3102</a>.<br /> <br /> tacmd addsystem -t d7 -n Primary:WINHOST:NT<br /> <br /> KUICAR010I: The agent type D7 is being deployed.<br /> <br /> KUICAR028I: The operation has been successfully queued for deployment, the transaction id<br /> is 1301348132141000000000041, use the getDeployStatus CLI to view the status.<br /> <br /> <br /> If running IBM Tivoli Monitoring Version 6.2.2 check the status of deployment by entering the tacmd getDeployStatus command. For example:<br /> <br /> tacmd getdeploystatus -g 1301348132141000000000041<br /> <br /> You may see the following error message: KDY0003E: The agent bundle D7 is already <br /> deployed to HUB_TEMS. An agent bundle cannot be deployed if it is already deployed.<br /> <br /> In this case, try tacmd updateagent command. For example:<br /> tacmd updateagent -t d7 -n Primary:WINHOST:NT<br /> <br /> <br /> Installing custom queries on the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server (Only to be applied if not already applied in FP2 or later).<br /> <br /> To support the lookup of managed system MAC addresses and agent versions by the IBM&reg; Tivoli&reg; Monitoring sensor, you must install custom queries on the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server.<br /> <br /> The custom queries are in the TEPS_Query.zip file in the /itm-discovery-support directory. The custom queries are defined now in only one SQL file (previously there were 3 SQL files):<br /> * install_zkd7.sql<br /> <br /> To install the custom queries on the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server, complete the following steps:<br /> <br /> Installing on Linux operating system:<br /> <br /> 1. Log in to the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, and copy the TEPS_Query.zip file to a <br /> local directory.<br /> <br /> In these instructions, the TEPS_Query.zip file is copied to the /tmp/teps directory and<br /> extracted. The install_zkd7.sql file is then located in the /tmp/teps directory.<br /> <br /> 2. Install the query:<br /> <br /> $CANDLEHOME/bin/itmcmd execute cq<br /> &quot;$CANDLEHOME/$BINARCH/cq/bin/KfwSQLClient -d KFW_DSN<br /> –f /tmp/teps/install_zkd7.sql&quot;<br /> <br /> 3. Stop the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server:<br /> <br /> $CANDLEHOME/bin/itmcmd agent stop cq<br /> <br /> 4. Start the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server:<br /> <br /> $CANDLEHOME/bin/itmcmd agent start cq<br /> <br /> Where:<br /> $CANDLEHOME is the ITM install directory<br /> $BINARCH is the directory for platform-specific binaries<br /> <br /> Installing on Windows&reg; operating system:<br /> <br /> 1. Log in to the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, and copy the TEPS_Query.zip file to a <br /> local directory.<br /> <br /> In these instructions, the TEPS_Query.zip file is copied to the c:\TEMP\TEPS <br /> directory and extracted. The install_zkd7.sql files are then located in the <br /> c:\TEMP\TEPS directory<br /> <br /> 2. Change to the directory where the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server is installed:<br /> <br /> cd c:\IBM\ITM\CNPS<br /> <br /> 3. Install the query:<br /> <br /> .\kfwsqlclient.exe /d KFW_DSN /f c:\TEMP\TEPS\install_zkd7.sql<br /> <br /> 4. From the Tivoli Monitoring Services window, restart the Tivoli Enterprise Portal <br /> Server.<br /> <br /> <br /> 8. Once the migration is complete you must update the database statistics using RUNSTATS for <br /> DB2 or DBMS_STATS for Oracle<br /> <br /> If you are using a DB2 database, see the DB2 database tuning topic in the TADDM <br /> Administrators Guide for more information. Also please note that for DB2 the db2updatestats.sh<br /> script must be run immediately after RUNSTATS completes.<br /> <br /> If you use an Oracle database, refer to the Oracle documentation for instructions about how to <br /> run DBMS_STATS.<br /> <br /> <br /> 9. Please note TADDM Fixpacks typically modify the WMI Provider (TaddmTool). When this occurs, the provider will be re-deployed to all Windows servers on the first discovery after the Fix Pack application. Re-deployment may require a WMI restart on the target. This can occur automatically depending on the value of com.collation.RestartWmiOnAutoDeploy in collation.properties.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 3.0.3. UPGRADING THE DATABASE MANUALLY<br /> <br /> The Fix Pack installation procedures above will upgrade the TADDM database to the current Fix<br /> Pack level. Normally customers do not need to manually upgrade the database. However, one can<br /> upgrade the database manually if your TADDM Server is at the current version, 7.2.0 FP6, but your <br /> TADDM Database is an earlier version of TADDM 7.2.0.<br /> <br /> These steps also may be required if the Fix Pack installation failed in the database steps. Please <br /> contact support if the database upgrade failed to confirm whether or not the DB must be restored <br /> before proceeding with a manual upgrade.<br /> <br /> If you are using a DB2 database, complete the following steps:<br /> <br /> 1. Log in as the DB2 database instance owner.<br /> <br /> 2. Run the following command:<br /> db2 reorgchk update statistics on table all &gt; reorg.out<br /> <br /> 3. In the reorg.out file, look in the reorg column for entries marked with a wildcard character. The<br /> wildcard character is an asterisk (*). For each line with a wildcard character, run the following<br /> command: db2 reorg table tablename db2 terminate<br /> <br /> If you use an Oracle database, refer to the Oracle documentation for instructions about how to <br /> reorganize the database.<br /> <br /> <br /> To manually upgrade the database, complete the following steps:<br /> <br /> 1. If it is running, stop the TADDM Server.<br /> <br /> 2. Change to the directory where the TADDM Server is installed. For example, the <br /> /opt/IBM/cmdb/dist/bin directory.<br /> <br /> 3. Use one of the following procedures to upgrade the database:<br /> <br /> - To upgrade for Linux, Solaris, AIX, or Linux on System z operating systems, run the following<br /> command: <br /> ./migration.sh -s -bv 7.2<br /> <br /> - To upgrade for Windows operating systems, run the following command:<br /> ./migration.bat -s -bv 7.2<br /> <br /> 4. Verify that no errors occurred by checking the appropriate log file:<br /> <br /> - For Linux, Solaris, AIX, or Linux on System z operating systems,<br /> $COLLATION_HOME/log/migration.log<br /> <br /> - For Windows operating systems, <br /> %COLLATION_HOME%\log\migration.log<br /> <br /> 5. Start the TADDM Server. Wait for the server to start. The server status must be running before you<br /> start the next step.<br /> <br /> If an error occurred, fix the problem and rerun the script. If no errors occurred, go to the next step.<br /> <br /> <br /> 6. Use one of the following procedures to perform the GUID migration:<br /> <br /> - To upgrade for Linux, Solaris, AIX, or Linux on System z operating systems, run the following<br /> 2 commands: <br /> <br /> -- update guid by class<br /> ./migration.sh -gc -bv 7.2<br /> <br /> -- update guid by id<br /> ./migration.sh -gi<br /> <br /> <br /> - To upgrade for Windows operating systems, run the following 2 commands: <br /> <br /> -- update guid by class<br /> ./migration.bat -gc -bv 7.2<br /> <br /> -- update guid by id<br /> ./migration.bat -gi<br /> <br /> <br /> 7. Use one of the following procedures to upgrade the database templates:<br /> <br /> - To upgrade for Linux, Solaris, AIX, or Linux on System z operating systems, run the following<br /> command: <br /> ./migration.sh -t -bv 7.2<br /> <br /> - To upgrade for Windows operating systems, run the following command: <br /> ./migration.bat -t -bv 7.2<br /> <br /> 8. Use one of the following procedures to upgrade sensor configurations:<br /> <br /> - To upgrade for Linux, Solaris, AIX, or Linux on System z operating systems, run the following <br /> command:<br /> ./migration.sh -sc<br /> <br /> - To upgrade for Windows operating systems, run the following command:<br /> ./migration.bat -sc<br /> <br /> 9. Verify that no errors occurred by checking the appropriate log file:<br /> <br /> - For Linux, Solaris, AIX, or Linux on System z operating systems,<br /> $COLLATION_HOME/log/migration.log<br /> <br /> - For Windows operating systems, <br /> %COLLATION_HOME%\log\migration.log<br /> <br /> If an error occurred, fix the problem and rerun the script. If no errors occurred, migration is <br /> complete.<br /> <br /> <br /> See &quot;7.0. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:&quot; for additional steps that you might need to do in your <br /> environment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4.0. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:<br /> <br /> <br /> The rollback process is different depending on the operating system. The instructions in this section <br /> assume that the default installation location was used. If you used a different location when installing <br /> and upgrading your server, substitute that path for the paths indicated in this section. <br /> <br /> To roll back the server from a Windows computer, complete the following steps: <br /> <br /> 1. Stop the server. To stop the server, make sure you are logged in with the user ID that was <br /> specified as the owner of the installation when the software was installed. Go to the <br /> %TADDM_HOME%\dist\bin directory. Enter the following command: stopserver.bat<br /> <br /> 2. Restore the backup files for the server. (You created a backup of these files before you <br /> upgraded). To restore the backup files for the server, complete the following steps: <br /> a. Go to the following directory: c:\ibm<br /> b. Rename the current installation directory to cmdb.bak.<br /> c. Extract the backup files. For example, use the following command: unzip cmdb.zip<br /> <br /> 3. Restore the database. Use one of the following procedures:<br /> <br /> - To restore a DB2 database, complete the following steps: <br /> a. Log in as the DB2 database instance owner. For example, you can use the db2inst1 ID.<br /> b. Run the following command: db2 restore database cmdb Replace cmdb with the name <br /> of your database.<br /> <br /> - To restore an Oracle database, refer to the Oracle documentation for instructions.<br /> <br /> 4. Start the TADDM server<br /> <br /> <br /> To roll back the upgrade from a Linux, Solaris, AIX, and Linux on System z operating systems, <br /> complete the following steps:<br /> <br /> 1. Stop the server. To stop the server, make sure that you are logged in with the user ID that was <br /> specified as the owner of the installation when the software was installed. Go to the <br /> %TADDM_HOME%/dist/bin directory. Enter the following command: ./control stop<br /> <br /> 2. If all of the Java processes have not stopped after entering the ./control stop command and <br /> waiting an appropriate amount of time for the processes to shut down, use the process ID <br /> information provided by the ps command to identify and stop the running Java processes related <br /> to TADDM: ps –ef | grep java<br /> <br /> 3. Delete the TADDM installation directory: /opt/IBM/cmdb<br /> <br /> 4. Restore the backup files for the server. (You created a backup of these files before you <br /> installed.) <br /> <br /> - To restore the backup files for the server, complete the following steps:<br /> a. Go to the following directory: /opt/IBM<br /> b. Rename the current installation directory to cmdb.bak.<br /> c. Extract the backup files. For example, use the following command: untar cmdb.tar<br /> <br /> 5. Use the following command to change file ownership to non-root (run as user): <br /> chown &lt;non-root_user_ID&gt;: &lt;non-root_user_group&gt; &lt;collation_home&gt;<br /> <br /> For example, chown cmdbuser : cmdbgrp /opt/ibm/cmdb/dist<br /> <br /> 6. Restore the database. Use one of the following procedures:<br /> <br /> - To restore a DB2 database, complete the following steps: <br /> a. Log in as the DB2 database instance owner.

   <br /> Once the Fix pack install is complete we recommend that the Customer compares the new and backed up collation.properties to make sure they did not lose any critical settings. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> Also on occasion we may overwrite collation.properties settings because of defect fixes or to improve performance, etc.
   <br /> 
   <br /> The following collation.properties settings were updated:
   <br /> 
   <br /> com.ibm.JdoQuery.FetchBatchSize is set to 1000 (Only if Customer has it set to less than 1000)
   <br /> com.collation.Discover.jvmargs.ibm added -Xdisableexplicitgc if it is not added already.
   <br /> com.collation.discover.agent.ITM.CmdWrapperSelectionPattern=.*[\\\\\&quot;&lt;&gt;#%}|$`]+.*|.*ifconfig.*|.*zonecfg.*
   <br /> 
   <br /> The following collation.properties settings were added:
   <br /> 
   <br /> New setting for externalization command for getting AIX OS version.
   <br /> 
   <br /> com.collation.discover.agent.command.oslevel.AIX
   <br /> default value will be oslevel, the property may be narrowed to IP eg.
   <br /> com.collation.discover.agent.command.oslevel.AIX.1.2.3.4 where 1.2.3.4 is IP. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> 
   <br /> OutOfMemory(OOM) issue occurred during a discovery of big SAP environment. The OOM exception happened during assigning runtime processes to discovered SAP servers.To overcome the issue please add a following entry to collation.properties: 
   <br /> 
   <br /> com.collation.discover.agent.SLD.useOsCache=false.
   <br /> 
   <br /> 
   <br /> If you want to change a default version of WebSphere (by default it is 5.x), you should add to the collation.properties one of the following entries: 
   <br /> 
   <br /> com.collation.discover.defaultWebSphereVersion=6.0
   <br /> com.collation.discover.defaultWebSphereVersion=6.1
   <br /> 
   <br /> Without these entries, the default version 5.x will be used.
   <br /> 
   <br /> 
   <br /> An OutOfMemory(OOM) event occurs during the Discovery of several Windows computers. This occurred because the Os cache size filled out. A new property was introduced to the collation.properties file, describing the maximum number of the object in the cache 
   <br /> 
   <br /> com.collation.OsFactory.cacheSize (default to 0: no limits with the cache)
   <br /> 
   <br /> 
   <br /> Connection to LDAP does not work correctly for a huge LDAP database . NullPointerException occurs when querying the login user groups so a new property was included in the collation.properties file 
   <br /> 
   <br /> com.collation.security.auth.ldapBaseGroupDN 
   <br /> 
   <br /> This property defines the root branch for searching for groups, to prevent searching the entire LDAP tree.

   <u>TADDM 64 bit support:</u>
   <br /> 
   <br /> This fix pack includes 64 bit support changes. TADDM now runs in 64 bit mode on 64 bit x Windows and x Linux.
   <br /> 
   <br /> 
   <br /> 
   <br /> 
   <u>Access list Migration:</u>
   <br /> 
   <br /> FP3 introduces Access list Migration from one TADDM Server to another. Please see the Feature Guide for FP3 for more information.
   <br /> 
   <br /> 
   <br /> 
   <br /> 
   <u>TADDM Discovery via ITM:</u>
   <br /> 
   <br /> The sensor supports Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server
   <br /> and Tivoli Monitoring agents for IBM Tivoli Monitoring Version 6.2.1-TIV-ITM-FP0001,
   <br /> 6.2.2-TIV-ITM-FP0002 or later. These fix pack levels include APAR IZ63983 which improves 
   <br /> IBM Tivoli Monitoring performance during TADDM discoveries.
   <br /> 
   <br /> 
   <br /> 
   <br /> 
   <u>LoadScope:</u>
   <br /> 
   <br /> loadscope.jy has a new option &quot;-q&quot;, which implements quick loading. When this option is used, the scope load process skips scope synchronization, which is the step of copying all scopes from the database to dist/etc/scope.properties. The option should be used with care, since scopes should be synchronized so that remote anchor servers have the most up to date scope elements (Defect 27973).
   <br /> 
   <br /> 
   <br /> 
   <br /> 
   <u>Anchor/Gateway:</u>
   <br /> 
   <br /> Windows 2008 32b and 64b are now supported as an Anchor/Gateway.
   <br /> 
   <br /> 
   <br />

   <br /> In 7.2.0 Fix Pack 4 dist/bin/user_views.sh script uses dist/etc/views/custom-views.xml file by default instead of the dist/bin/user-views.xml The problem was introduced in APAR IZ89289 in FP4.
   <br /> 
   <br /> APAR IZ96829 
   <br /> This feature adds new abilities to TADDM change events. Now included are:
   <br /> 1. An ability to configure change events to send &quot;cause events&quot;. If a change occurs on a tracked 
   <br /> resource such as a computer system, and this change was propagated to the computer system 
   <br /> because of changes to lower-level resources such as a service or a file, you can now configure 
   <br /> change events to send events about the lower-level changes, in addition to the event about the 
   <br /> tracked resource.
   <br /> 2. An ability to configure change events with filters that control which classes of objects are allowed to 
   <br /> generate cause events.
   <br /> 
   <br /> 3. For OMNIbus 7.3.1 event recipients, an ability to attach the unique ID of a 
   <br /> tracked resource to any cause events that are generated by TADDM.
   <br /> See the new documentattion 
   <br /> in $COLLATION_HOME/etc/EventConfig.xml for more details.&quot;

   <br /> When a GUID for a particular ComputerSystem changes after re-discovery - i.e. when changes primary naming rule - Extended Attributes, Dependencies, Business Applications and Business Services associations that were assigned to the object before the discovery are lost. The issue occurs when one of the naming rules changes (usually signature) after last discovery, so the newly discovered object 
   <br /> is assigned a new guid. There might be also missing information (especially the SoftwareComponents 
   <br /> visible in Packages tab in Product Console) in OSInstalled object associated with the ComputerSystem. 
   <br /> However the information is added with the subsequent rediscovery (discovery profile for the second discovery must contain at least &lt;OS&gt;ComputerSystemSensors, e.g.: LinuxComputerSystemSensor, WindowsComputerSystemSensor, etc.). So in such cases described in the APAR, it is necessary to do discovery twice to make all the information present.

   <br /> several problems may occur with invalid IPs and nulls which can cause the Discovery to hang for 10-15 minutes.

Audit failures shows that the user which runs the TaddmTool command on Gateway attempts to make a connection to target. The issue is caused by 2 things:
   <br /> 1. There is a defect in .Net framework. It is confirmed by MS See the following note: 
   <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/967622/">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/967622/</a> and there is a hotfix available for this defect here:

   <br /> 2. TaddmTool uses [STAThread] attribute in C# which causes that audit 
   <br /> failure is logged. This needs to be removed.

   <br /> The TPCStorageSensor does not check all TADDM DB2 access list entries. The documentation for the TPCStorageSensor states that the Customer must add the credentials for the TPC database to the DB2 access list. However, the only DB2 user name that the sensor checks for is the user name from the TPC server.config file. Note that the TPCStorageSensor only requires read only access to the TPC database. Thus a DB2 user with read only privileges should be sufficient for the sensor. The DB2 user defined in the server.config is an admin user. Issue can occur if customer do not want to give TADDM access to this DB2 admin user.

   <br /> When com.collation.security.enabledatalevelsecurity=true in $COLLATION_HOME/etc/collation.properties, editing Extended Attributes through the Product Console will cause multiple views to stop functioning in the console. Some affected views are Access List, Custom Servers and Computer Systems. Selecting a view after editing Extended Attributes will display a blank panel even if data should be returned.

   <br /> When TADDM runs on Windows and JBoss is running on Unix, the JBoss sensor cannot discover 
   <br /> App Descriptors. In the JBossSensor log you can find:

   <br /> The ConnectionDependencyAgent takes a lot of time (relatively,compared to other agents
   <br /> in TopologyBuilder phase). The issue will occur if there are many unattached RuntimeProcesses 
   <br /> in the DB and they significantly out number the attached ones. To check the count of the unattached and attached RuntimeProcesses invoke the following two queries: 
   <br /> [1] dist/bin/dbquery.sh 'select count(*) from rtproc where unattached_x = 1' 
   <br /> [2] dist/bin/dbquery.sh 'select count(*) from rtproc' 
   <br /> The first query returns number of unattached ones and the second returns the number of ALL 
   <br /> RuntimeProcesses. To get the number of attached RuntimeProcesses simply subtract the result 
   <br /> of the query [1] from the result [2].&quot;

   <br /> The Solaris Global zone is properly discovered, however the local zones are not displayed. 
   <br /> The following message can be found in the trace debug logs: Could not get IP address for 
   <br /> zone TADDM is using the following command to determine the IP address of the local zones: 
   <br /> zonecfg -z gfxldv info | grep address: | awk '{print $2}' The above command can return no 
   <br /> results either because it was masked, or because the local zone has exclusive access to the 
   <br /> network interface, hence the IP address is not known by the global zone. For such cases a 
   <br /> different mechanism is used based on zlogin command. This alternative mechanism can also 
   <br /> fail if multiple physical interfaces are available.

   <br /> In the Product Console, if you create a Contact and do not fill out all fields in the Contact Details panel, the e-mail address for the Contact will not appear when you later open the Contact Details for editing.

   <br /> During a discovery run, the Product Console GUI shows the count of the discovered 
   <br /> components in the Components Found field. For example:
   <br /> Status Running
   <br /> Components Found : xx
   <br /> Sensors Running : yy
   <br /> If the Product Console is in a language other than English, Components Found is always 
   <br /> shown as 0. The other fields are correct.

   <br /> The SqlServer sensor tries to connect to the remote SqlServer instance using a list of ip_addresses, discovered in the Sql Server registry/configuration, along with the ip address that seeded the sensor. The ip address that seeded the sensor should be tried first, for performance reasons because it is most 
   <br /> likely to succeed. Currently the seed ip address is tried last,and the sensor may timeout before attempting the ip address that will allow discovery to continue. Also when the SqlServer sensor times-out, the sensors logs give no indication of a timeout being exceeded, and the sensor continues running until killed by the watchdog.

   <br /> When a Windows Anchor has 2 IPs, one in the network available for TADDM server 
   <br /> machine and the other in the private network. This machine does not know itself 
   <br /> by the public IP and cannot communicate with itself using the public IP. 
   <br /> The system is discovered successfully by the TADDM Server (Session sensor, 
   <br /> Windows CS sensor run fine). The problem is when the Anchor sensor runs. Anchor 
   <br /> sensor is to run the TaddmTool command using the public IP. This fails because 
   <br /> the box cannot communicate with itself on public IP vi WMI. Customer may see 
   <br /> stack trace in AnchorSensor log:

   <br /> Some objects become incomplete in the DB if during discovery there is a merge operation 
   <br /> resulting in a delete. Generally, the result of the incomplete delete is CIs that exist 
   <br /> in one table but not another, for example cmdb_guid_alias and not persobj. Incomplete objects 
   <br /> can cause operational issues with TADDM, such as:
   <br /> 1) api deletes or queries fail with; CTJOX0205E The application cannot convert the data to XML: 
   <br /> com.collation.proxy.api.client.ApiException: [PLATFORM.XML.E.25] The application is unable to get 
   <br /> find object members:
   <br /> java.lang.NullPointerException... 
   <br /> 2) If the CI is part of a business application, the business application edit screen may show a 
   <br /> blank list of objects and an NPE will be thrown in the client log. 
   <br /> 3) Sensors may fail with errors in Topology.log containing &quot;FailedObject&quot; or &quot;Object Not Exists&quot;.

   <br /> The ITMScopeSensor terminates abnormally due to a NullPointerException during initialization. No ITM scopes are created and no systems can be discovered via ITM. local-anchor.&lt;host&gt;.ITMScopeSensor.log has the following messages:
   <br /> [Thread: 0,8495] INFO cdb.STDOUT - Creating OS Version Map...... 
   <br /> [Thread: 0,8495] INFO cdb.STDOUT - Getting nodes for affinity:0008000000000000000000000000000000000000000 (Windows)

   <br /> 
   <br /> The error is most likely to occur in a large ITM environment (hundreds or thousands of agents) where new OS agents (usually Windows) are coming on-line during the ITMScopeSensor initialization. For example, in the sample log snippet, initialization was running for 25 minutes when the error occurred.

   <br /> API queries fail for certain MQLS that contain class qualified properties in the &quot;where&quot; clause. The issue occurs when the query for objects of a particular class contains (the same class)-qualified property reference (e.g. &quot;select *from ConfigFile where ConfigFile.displayName contains 'someValue'&quot;) and there is a property in the class with the same name (comparing case insensitively) as the class itself.

   <br /> Topology Out Of Memory (OOM) occurs because of ModelObjectNormalizer. While storing Windows objects GUID exists exceptions occur. TADDM tries to remove it and store it again. While removing, TADDM tries to calculate the GUID for the object and it causes that the object normalizer is triggered, which causes OOM. Javacore will show a very long list of ModelObjectNormalizer called recursively. If it starts with BaseJdo.persistOther() method, then its this issue:

   <br /> When running a discovery without the ITMScopeSensor, the SessionSensor connects to the ITM server and runs queries against all the ITM endpoints in the environment. The queries may consume considerable time, which is unnecessary to discover a subset of ITM endpoints. 
   <br /> Sample SessionSensor log entries: 
   <br /> [DiscoverWorker-3] - login(XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX, 1920, Sysadmin, **********)
   <br /> [DiscoverWorker-3] - MSN to Agent Version Map...
   <br /> [DiscoverWorker-3] - Creating OS VersionMap... 
   <br /> [DiscoverWorker-3] - 397 nodes returned.
   <br /> [DiscoverWorker-3] - 161 nodes returned.
   <br /> [DiscoverWorker-3] - 948 nodes returned.
   <br /> [DiscoverWorker-3] - Creating MAC Address Map... 
   <br /> [DiscoverWorker-3] - 397 nodes returned.
   <br /> [DiscoverWorker-3] - 161 nodes returned.
   <br /> [DiscoverWorker-3] - 948 nodes returned.
   <br /> [DONE_DISCOVER_SENSOR_CLEANUP_DiscoverWorker-3] - Executing query: zkd7.MAC_Address_NT_T, from cursor position 0
   <br /> &lt;&lt;end of log - did not finish&gt;&gt; 
   <br /> In this example, initialization was still running after 11 minutes due to the number of ITM nodes (over 1500) to be queried. The last log entry - containing thread marker DONE_DISCOVER_SENSOR_CLEANUP - indicates the SessionSensor has exceeded its configured time limit (10 minutesby default) and has timed out.

   <br /> LinuxComputerSystemSensor fails if the zLinux system to be discovered is installed on a system z LPAR. The sensor will work if the zLinux system is installed in a z/VM container and the vmcp module is loaded in zLinux. The sensor running against a system z LPAR will finish the discovery, but will store no zLinux OS data.The reason for the failure is that the LinuxComputerSystemSensor discovers that it is running on zLinux and tries to run the /sbin/vmcp command, which is not available on zLinux servers running in a system z LPAR. The LinuxComputerSystemSensor logic should be able to distinguish between the two hosting environments (z/VM or z-LPAR) by analyzing /proc/sysinfo.

   <br /> The TPCStorageSensor or HostStorageSensor produce results in the TADDM database, but expected relationships are missing in the database and in the topology view of the user interface. Expected relationships include: 
   <br /> - ComputerSystem uses StorageSubsystem 
   <br /> - FCVolume based on StorageVolume 
   <br /> - AppServer uses StorageSubsystem 
   <br /> The following query can be used to display 'uses' relationships: ./api.sh find --depth 1 &quot;select * from Uses where target equals'{storageSubSystemGuid}' &quot; 
   <br /> The source of the missing relationships is an Attribute Not Set exception thrown by the Host Storage Connection topobuilder

   <br /> When Apache configuration files contain some white space characters (e.g.tabs, spaces) in places they are allowed to be (regarding Apache configuration
   <br /> file syntax specification) TADDM might not recognize the directives properly or not at all. The issue came out in case of the &quot;Listen&quot; directive which was
   <br /> immediately followed by tab character (instead of space as expected By TADDM). It caused an error: 
   <br /> DiscoverManager [DiscoverWorker-0] ApacheServerSensor-XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX-80 ERROR web.ApacheConfigHelper -com.collation.discover.agent.AgentException: CTJTD0080E The listen port from the Apache configuration is not available.

   <br /> 
   <br /> The same white space issue might be encountered for every directive or tag in Apache configuration files parsed by TADDM, but the effect might be different. In every case though, the directive will not be processed which may lead to missing information about particular Apache instance.

   <br /> 
   <br /> Features are included in this fixpack; under APAR IZ86172 (see list below for all details)
   <br /> 
   <br /> There are no new updates to the features PDF for Fix Pack 4 so for information on non-sensor features included in prior Fixpacks - please see the previous Fix Pack 7.2.0.0-TIV-ITADDM-FP0003.PDF located at:

   <br /> tivihelp/v10r1/topic/com.ibm.taddmsensors.doc_72/welcome_page/welcome.html
   <br /> contains information about the sensor updates that are delivered in TADDM 7.2
   <br /> Sensor Interim Feature 1 and Fix Pack 4. This sensor information is more
   <br /> up-to-date than the sensor information in the TADDM 7.2 information center. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> 
   <br /> APAR IZ86172
   <br /> Feature 1 
   <br /> Add retry logic and fix performance for findchanges from ITIC. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> Feature 2 
   <br /> Add all process definitions defined inside WebSphere configuration file to the UI for zWas. They will only be available in this view, they will not be available for change history, component comparison, etc. The latter will be handled by a feature in the future. The feature enables to see information about all Process Definitions associated with a given WebSphere Server. This information is visible on a separate tab 'Process Definition from file' in Details section. The prerequisite for retrieving this info is to run a deep WebSphere discovery and in case of WebSphere on z/OS also to load IDML books containing information about WebSphere. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> Feature 3 
   <br /> Set the fqdn to the sysName in the SnmpMib2 Sensor if the fqdn is not found. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> Feature 4 
   <br /> Let discover complete even if unfinished change events. This message will appear in the logs when change propagation does not complete:
   <br /> DEBUG state.EventPropagator - num events started but not done for this runId = nn&quot;

   <br /> TADDM suffers an OutOfMemory(OOM) from the ComputerSystemConsolidationAgent when operating on a large computer system data set. The OutOfMemory message occurs in the TopologyBuilder.log with a calling stack like so -

   <br /> 
   <br /> APAR IZ86564
   <br /> In 7.2 FP1 a change was introduced when launching a Domain from the Enterprise Domain requires the Secure port 9431 and HTTPS to download the JNLP file. The Secure port 9431/HTTPS is used regardless if a normal &quot;Start&quot; or &quot;Start in Secure Mode&quot; is selected.
   <br /> 
   <br /> APAR IZ86599
   <br /> Having systems with two or more Apache instances which are distinct from each other (distinct processes listening on distinct addresses and ports) but use the same configuration. During discovery TADDM identifies the two processes properly, but during the reconciliation it reads for both instances just the first Listen (XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:80) because for TADDM the &lt;IfDefine&gt; entries are meaningless which causes an overlap of the Apaches names which results in one single Apache instance.
   <br /> 
   <br /> APAR IZ86671
   <br /> During an incremental sync constraint errors can occur on the many to many tables with implicitpointer and stored procedure UPDATEJOINKEY. The Sync log will contain errors similar to the following:
   <br /> Synchronizer [TableThread$6] ERROR util.ImplicitPointerHelper -java.sql.SQLException: ORA-00001: unique constraint (CMDB.OPERATINGSYSENTS_FD67DE48X_PK) violated ORA-06512: at &quot;CMDB.UPDATEJOINKEY&quot;, line 1 ORA-06512: at line 1 at oracle.jdbc.driver.DatabaseError.throwSqlException(DatabaseError.java:112)
   <br /> This occurs when a cmdb_guid_alias pair on the domain does not match the Enterprise Domain (typical in an overlap domain scenario). Eg. the alias on the domain has a different master on the Enterprise Domain, and the master on the domain also has a different alias set on Enterprise Domain.
   <br /> 
   <br /> APAR IZ86689
   <br /> After a successful discovery the Topology Builder hang on 5 Percent. This situation can occur when the TADDM DB has many computer systems.
   <br /> 
   <br /> APAR IZ86830
   <br /> When running a large discovery, after a few thousand sensors are in the list, the Product Console becomes unresponsive and the javaw.exe process uses the entire CPU (entire one CPU core). Problem can occur when one of the columns is sorted.
   <br /> 
   <br /> APAR IZ87022
   <br /> When running getChangedClasses through the API on an Enterprise Domain it pulls back any classes that changed on the Enterprise Domain only. However as the Change_history_table is not synced from the Domains some of the changed classes may not get picked up. These calls are now also delegated to the Domains to make sure all the changed classes are picked up.
   <br /> 
   <br /> APAR IZ87028
   <br /> Invoking queries that result in many objects being returned can cause an OutOfMemoryError. The reason for this issue was an inefficient algorithm that processed the data.
   <br />

   <br /> A (virtual) AIX computer system running in an LPAR with multiple NICs,discovered by the TADDM AIXComputerSystemSensor, does not reconcile with an AIX computer systems discovered by the TPCStorageSensor Summary: Duplicate computer systems get discovered by the AIXComputerSystemSensor and the TPCStorageSensor for LPARs on pSystems. In this configuration, no matching naming rules are found to enable reconciliation between the computer systems discovered by both these sensors: -For the signature naming rule (the most common naming rule), the TPCStorageSensor cannot create the correct signature because TPCstores only one IP address for a system with multiple NICs. TPC can also collect all the MAC addresses for these systems and there is no way to map the ip address to its matching mac address.. -For the model+manufacturer+serial number+VMID naming rule, the TPCStorageSensor cannot discover the LPAR ID (VMID) because it is not discovered by TPC.

   <br /> The Db2Windows sensor fails to discover DB2 because it cannot find the following key in the Windows registry after trying both 32bit and 64bit registry: /DB2 Folder Name This is because this registry exists in another subfolder e.g.: /InstalledCopies/CIFCOPY/DB2 Folder Name. The following error occurs in the Db2Windows sensor log:

   <br /> The MSSQL sensor template is missing one exclusion: When there is a Windows Service called, the sensor template configuration causes MSSQL sensor to run against such process as it assumes it is an MSSQL instance when its not. This is an incorrect message - because there is no instance under this service. MSSQL template should contain one more exclusion: for MSSQLServerOLAPService windows service. The Current configuration is that sensor triggers when Windows Service name contains a MSSQL string. Described service contains this string. But this is not an MSSQL instance.

   <br /> APAR IZ76748
   <br /> Invalid IP addresses i.e. entries greater than 255 (e.g 9.161.260.25) are accepted by the loadscope.jy script which results in a failed discovery and in some cases will cause TADDM to crash. The following errors were reported: 
   <br /> ProfileManager [RMI TCP Connection(144)-127.0.0.1] ERROR ip.ScopedProps- [PLATFORM.IP.E.27] Invalid syntax for scope 
   <br /> LAB com.collation.platform.ip.ScopeSyntaxException: CTJOP0007E The following IP address is not valid: 9.161.260.25. Enter a valid IP address.

   <br /> Active Services do not merge. During a Discovery of a particular operating system (such as the AIX sensor) is run and after it the Customer runs a stack scan sensor then the Customer is not able to see the Active Services. Information from the Stack Scan and Operating system sensor do not merge.

   <br /> The snmpmib2sensor can get stuck in a loop if it encounters a empty mib. This loop runs until an OutOfMemory(OOM) error occurs.
   <br /> 
   <br /> APAR IZ78115
   <br /> In TADDM the Oracle Sensor sets the Home Directory using select query: &quot;select substr(file_spec,1,instr(file_spec,'lib')-2) from dba_libraries&quot; where library_name='DBMS_SUMADV_LIB' which overwrites the home directory retrieved from the ps command. The Oracle Sensor should not overwrite this. It should use it only if the ps command does not contain home directory.
   <br /> 
   <br /> APAR IZ78127
   <br /> During a discovery of Windows Computer Systems customer receives storage error on the WindowsComputerSystemSensor. Storage error appears because the IP interface has an invalid subnet. In the DiscoverObserver.log the follow errror was reported:

   <br /> When discovering Solaris Local zones, the file systems inherited from Global zones are missing. The file systems inherited from Global zone are being stored when the Global zone is discovered. However those file system get overwritten when the Local zone is discovered directly. A new collation property will be added, defining the command name for discovering local file systems on Local zone: 
   <br /> com.collation.platform.os.command.filesystems.zones
   <br /> 
   <br /> The default value of this property is df -kF lofs | grep -v 'No such file or directory' | grep -v 'Input/output error' | grep -v 'Filesystem' | awk '{print $1, $2, $4, $6}'

   <br /> 7.2 Fix Pack 3 Feature APAR 
   <br /> 
   <br /> Feature 1 
   <br /> Re-format the BIRT inventory report to landscape 
   <br /> 
   <br /> Feature 2 
   <br /> VirtualCenter discovery via ITMScopeSensor should use VirtualCenter credentials from the access list 
   <br /> Feature 3 
   <br /> In the 7.2FP1 $COLLATION_HOME/etc/EventConfig.xml 
   <br /> 
   <br /> &lt;!-- Template for Netcool/OMNIBus event recipient --&gt; 
   <br /> &lt;recipient name=&quot;enterprise-eventhost-omnibus&quot; type=&quot;omnibus&quot;&gt;
   <br /> &lt;address&gt;netcool.mycompany.com&lt;/address&gt; 
   <br /> &lt;port&gt;9998&lt;/port&gt; 
   <br /> 
   <br /> &lt;config&gt;C:/code/taddm_dev_change_event/builds/dist/properties/omnibus.eif.properties&lt;/config&gt; 
   <br /> &lt;/recipient&gt; 
   <br /> 
   <br /> Should be: 
   <br /> &lt;recipient name=&quot;enterprise-eventhost-omnibus&quot; type=&quot;omnibus&quot;&gt;
   <br /> &lt;config&gt;/opt/IBM/cmdb/dist/properties/omnibus.eif.properties&lt;/config&gt; 
   <br /> &lt;/recipient&gt; 
   <br /> 
   <br /> There are 3 suggested changes:
   <br /> 1 &amp; 2: The address and port tags are for ITM only and should not be in the Netcool/OMNIBus section 
   <br /> 3: the config tag should point to the default location of the tec or omnibus property file location (and not include &quot;/code/taddm_dev_change_event/builds&quot;)
   <br /> 
   <br /> Feature 4 
   <br /> Anchor error &quot;Directory does not exist&quot; In TADDM 7.2, when the TADDM Server creates an anchor, it copies all necessary jars, etc to the anchor. The error.log 
   <br /> on the anchor shows the following msg:
   <br /> 
   <br /> [main] ERROR util.DirFileScanner - Directory does not exist /root/coll7.2/extensions/deployed
   <br /> 
   <br /> That file does not in fact exist on the anchor, but it does not affect the function of the anchor. The anchor works without a problem, so this is just an erroneous error. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> Feature 5 
   <br /> Fix adds serial number collection to the entitymibsensor to provide an alternate naming rule match other then signature for this customers case where the MAC or IP is changing. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> Feature 6 
   <br /> Update the Fixpack Silent install to include the following reminder message upon starting the install; 
   <br /> Silent mode will give no feedback on the status of your migration. Please review all logs in the installLogs directory for this install... 
   <br /> 
   <br /> Feature 7 
   <br /> Display the Servant JVM, rather than the Adjunct for z/WAS 
   <br /> 
   <br /> Feature 8 
   <br /> Change SnmpMib2 sensor to use sysname if FQDN returned is empty or ONLY loopback or localhost. 
   <br /> Feature 9 
   <br /> Access List migration support.
   <br /> 
   <br /> APAR IZ78426
   <br /> When discovering the Global zone, the NFS file systems discovered on the Local zone is missing. This is happening because the Global zone sensor overwrites the file systems discovered by the Local zone sensor.The discovering of file systems from Global zones will be disabled since we are not discovering all the file systems from the global zone.
   <br /> 
   <br /> APAR IZ78427
   <br /> When using the loadscope.jy script, the scope will load but the loadscope.jy script hangs after processing the last record.

   <br /> When discovering Cisco IOS switches, the Port tab should display Autonegotiation for Duplex and Autonegotiation columns when Autonegotiation is enabled.
   <br /> 
   <br /> APAR IZ78485
   <br /> The TADDM inventory views BIRT report contains duplicates. The report contains ip interfaces not belonging to a given machine. Duplicates can be observed in the situation when a server has many ip interfaces. The second issue regards the situation when server contains LPAR which have the same serial number as host machine.
   <br /> 
   <br /> APAR IZ78514
   <br /> Integration Scenario with ITM for VI. ITM Agent creates an event during vMotion indentifying the UUID of the VMWare Guest and Host. The UUID given by ITM uses Uppercase while TADDM uses both upper and lowercase. e.g. 
   <br /> - FROM ITM-34353533-3439-5553-4538-32314E393634 FROM TADDM -&lt;UUID&gt;34353533-3439-5553-4538-32314e393634&lt;/UUID&gt;
   <br /> TADDM was changed to return uppercase.
   <br /> 
   <br /> APAR IZ78655
   <br /> The FP installer fails on Solaris using Bourne shell and non-root user. This is because the shell is not returning values for $USER and $GROUP and the installFP.sh drops into code believing the user is root. The following exception is found in the install log;

   <br /> Users experience occasional topology thread deadlocking due to conflicting threads reading and clearing the JDO cache at the same time. This can be see as a circular lock in the java core where one of the two threads has a call to evictAll() in the stack. If the discovery no longer progresses check the Java stack. Force a javacore by running a &quot;kill -3&quot; on the collation java processes. Check the javacore files for locks similar to this seen from the TopologyManager JVM:

On Windows a lock can occur if the user has a command prompt or explorer window opened to the path. The Installer should fail if it unable to delete files due to locking rather then continue on. For example, if the installer cannot delete the the tomcat files, TADDM may fail to start after what appears to be a successful install of the Fixpack.

   <br /> The IP address for an AppServer is set in the Product Console to the primary IP address of a computer when the process of AppServer listens on all interfaces. After the fix it will be set to 0.0.0.0 represents all interfaces).
   <br /> 
   <br /> APAR IZ70549
   <br /> There were problems discovering AIX with virtual interfaces and applications running on those servers.
   <br /> The ifconfig output is different for virtual interfaces and looks similar to the following: 
   <br /> vi1: flags=84000041&lt;UP,RUNNING,64BIT&gt; inet XX.XX.XXX.XXX netmask 0xfffffff8 iflist : en2 en4. 
   <br /> Currently TADDM ignores that output. With this fix we will not set a hardware address for the virtual interface.
   <br /> 
   <br /> APAR IZ70697
   <br /> Type of dependencies between objects in 'Show Dependencies' dialog in the Product Console is always set to 'Manually added' although part of them is automatically discovered.
   <br /> 
   <br /> APAR IZ70725
   <br /> TADDM takes the LDAP group from its users. If a user does not exist in the LDAP server, then TADDM does not log in any user.

   <br /> When one of the Access Collections members is set to null, a NullPointerException is thrown during the editing of AccessCollection.
   <br /> 
   <br /> APAR IZ70824
   <br /> During a discovery of Solaris local zone with a running Websphere MQ, two sensors were triggered. One for local zone and one for the global zone. Only the sensor for local zone should be kicked off. The sensor for global zone was started because Websphere MQ process is on the forced processes list.
   <br /> 
   <br /> APAR IZ70906 
   <br /> After discovering all Citrix Servers from a Farm, the Farm name is FARM (null:0) as the Citrix Sensor 
   <br /> cannot obtain the ip address of Citrix Server Farm if it is not stored in the windows registry, therefore 
   <br /> it sets the name of the farm to null and 0. However, when only the CITRIXFARM server is discovered, the name 
   <br /> is correct, i.e.. FARM(IPADDR: port). In the CitrixSensor.log, the following can be seen: cdb.CitrixServerAgent
   <br /> - DNS Lookup host: null cdb.CitrixServerAgent -Unable to set farm IP address for farm: PLCTXFARM(null:0)
   <br /> 
   <br /> APAR IZ71762
   <br /> WAS 6.x discovery fails when using TADDM 7.2. The following error can be seen in the logs: 
   <br /> Caused by: [SOAPException: faultCode=SOAP-ENV:Client; msg=Error opening socket: java.net.SocketException: 
   <br /> [SOAPException: faultCode=SOAP-ENV:Client; msg=Error opening socket:java.net.SocketException:

   <br /> 
   <br /> APAR IZ71872
   <br /> When discovering Cisco devices via SNMP, the Serial Number from the CISCO-STACK-MIB will be used to populate the serial number of the device. This was done following feedback from Cisco that this should be the primary source of the serial number.
   <br /> 
   <br /> APAR IZ72045
   <br /> Problem removing Business Applications: If the App Descriptor path is not set to be captured for the Custom Server and the App Descriptor file is deleted from the file system, the App Descriptors are not being deleted from the database. This is happening because the sensor does not attempt to discover the App Descriptors if the capture file list is empty, and then the old App Descriptor remains.
   <br /> 
   <br /> APAR IZ72051
   <br /> If the user that runs a discovery on an AIX target does not have the authority to run the 'entstat' command in the session sensor the TADDM Discovery proceeds to the other sensors, but in the end the AixComputerSystemSensor, GenericSeverSensor, StorageSensor fail with the error CTJTD3521E Error - A storage error occurred.

   <br /> 
   <br /> APAR IZ72965
   <br /> The Java product console fails with NullPointerException when the UIManager returns empty Look And Feel Defaults for application fonts. The problem can appear with latest JRE available for starting Product Console. This problem was correct in Fix Pack 001 under a different defect and verified in Fix pack 002.
   <br /> 
   <br /> APAR IZ73013
   <br /> The field ZSeries Computer System in the tab General for ZCoupling Facility was mainly empty. Therefore there was no link to ZSeries on which this operating system runs. Now this field will display a name of the ZSeries CS and it will be a link to this CS.
   <br /> 
   <br /> APAR IZ73131
   <br /> DB2 sensor performance: The DB2 sensor run command &quot;getent passwd&quot; which execution can take a long time to complete so this was replaced with &quot;cat /etc/passwd&quot;.

   <br /> The ITM sensor cannot discover ITM 6.2.2 Windows endpoints which do not have Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on the ITM endpoint. The error occurs when the TADDM server attempts to copy TaddmTool.exe to the Windows target. The file is copied to the target as a Base64-encoded file, but it cannot be decoded on the target because there is no JRE to execute the decoder classes. The SessionSensor log contains error messages similar to the

   <br /> Duplicate instance of MSSQL server is created during a discovery. This can occur when a box with 2 IP interfaces MSSQL server listen only on 1 IP interface. Each time the box is discovered using different IP addresses causing the MSSQL server objects do not merge because SAPPrimaryAddress contains the session address.
   <br /> 
   <br /> Please note: This APAR may cause duplicates of MSSQL Server to be created if they were discovered before the fix for this APAR was applied. In such cases, the old instances of MSSQL need to be deleted and during the next discovery, no new duplicates will be created.

   <br /> OutOfMemory(OOM) error when HOST_SCSI_PATH query is enabled. Depending on the storage environment, the HOST_SCSI_PATH query can return a large result set which might lead to an 
   <br /> OutOfMemory error. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> Solution: 
   <br /> The sensor caps the number of rows it processes for the 
   <br /> HOST_SCSI_PATH query to a default value of 20,000 in order to 
   <br /> prevent OutOfMemory errors. The value is based on: 
   <br /> 
   <br /> * Default heap size of the discover JVM (which is 1024 MB) 
   <br /> * Default agent timeout value (which is 600000 ms) 
   <br /> In addition, you can configure the sensor to prevent 
   <br /> OutOfMemory messages, when the HOST_SCSI_PATH query is enabled
   <br /> by using one of the methods described in the sensor information center

   <br /> If the following property in collation.properties is set to false: com.collation.platform.gcLogicalConnections 
   <br /> Then a large number of logical connections will build up in the TADDM database. When the property is set back to &quot;true&quot; the TADDM TopologyBuilder will try to load all of these logical connections at once. If there are too many, the TADDM JVM will encounter an OutOfMemory(OOM) condition. This solution will load the logical connections in smaller chunks so as to avoid the situation.
   <br /> 
   <br /> So with this fix the property com.collation.platform.gcLogicalConnection is no longer used so it is impossible to skip Logical Connection cleanup. The customers should remove it from collation.properties file.

   <br /> OutOfMemory(OOM) Exception occurs in the Topology JVM when running a Full Sync operation from IBM Tivoli Integration Composer (ITIC). In a Full Sync operation, all configuration items (CI) objects are read from TADDM. The OutOfMemory Exception is more likely to occur with large TADDM databases (greater than 10,000 CIs) and may take several hours to occur . The error is a result of heap allocation that accumulates over time. The error is more likely to occur when ITIC is configured with depth level of 3 (default) or greater for all TADDM objects. Symptoms include: 1. javacore.&lt;timestamp&gt;.txt file with &quot;java/lang/OutOfMemoryError&quot; received 2. Heap dump analysis (e.g. MDD4J) showing majority of Retained Heap consumed by class kodo.runtime.PersistenceManagerImpl.

   <br /> 7.2 Feature APAR;
   <br /> 
   <br /> Feature 1; 
   <br /> Due to large logging outputs and running in DEBUG can sometimes cause TADDM to run out of memory(OutOfMemory exception). This is because we are logging large outputs, like lsof. Changes were made to the logging design to allow truncation of the results to the logger at a certain configurable number of bytes.
   <br /> 
   <br /> Feature 2; 
   <br /> MQ server sensor command need to be externalized. 
   <br /> This fix provides 3 new properties which all add sudo for MQ command: 
   <br /> com.collation.discover.agent.MqServerAgent.versionCommand 
   <br /> property allow add sudo for mq version command. eg 
   <br /> com.collation.discover.agent.MqServerAgent.versionCommand=sudo 
   <br /> -u mqm 
   <br /> command enable add sudo MQ status command (dspmq) 
   <br /> com.collation.discover.agent.MqServerAgent.statusCommand 
   <br /> Enable add sudo to MQSeries commands (runmqsc) 
   <br /> com.collation.discover.agent.MqServerAgent.mqscCommand 
   <br /> 
   <br /> Each of property may be narrow to os name or particular IP. eg. 
   <br /> com.collation.discover.agent.MqServerAgent.mqscCommand.Linux.1.2
   <br /> .3.4=sudo -u mqm 
   <br /> 
   <br /> Feature 3; 
   <br /> Change this message from DEBUG to TRACE to prevent excessive log
   <br /> growth; 
   <br /> DEBUG ip.SystemSigner - calculateAddressSpace(10.1.2.3) -&gt; 
   <br /> null (no anchor zone) 
   <br /> 
   <br /> Feature 4: 
   <br /> The com.collation.platform.os.WindowsOs.AutoDeploy property is 
   <br /> not scoped, and user cannot set this property for a particular 
   <br /> ip address 
   <br /> 
   <br /> Feature 5 
   <br /> Enable hardware address for virtual IP in Linux. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> This feature is to enable the discovery of hardware addresses for 
   <br /> virtual interfaces for Linux. 
   <br /> By default, the hardware address for virtual interfaces is not 
   <br /> discovered, the new collation property: 
   <br /> 
   <br /> com.collation.discover.agent.ignoreVirtualMAC (default set to 
   <br /> true) 
   <br /> 
   <br /> is added to discover the hardware address. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> Feature 6 
   <br /> Externalize serial number on power linux. 
   <br /> The following command is used to get serial number: 
   <br /> cat /proc/device-tree/system-id | cut -c 7-13&quot; 
   <br /> 
   <br /> In some case cat needs sudo. 
   <br /> The following will be added to collation.properties; 
   <br /> 
   <br /> com.collation.discover.agent.command.cat 
   <br /> 
   <br /> Example to specify cat with sudo: 
   <br /> com.collation.discover.agent.command.cat.1.2.3.4=sudo cat 
   <br /> where 1.2.3.4 should be replace with valid IP address of the 
   <br /> target. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> Feature 7 
   <br /> The ITM API does not return any data to the TADDM sensor. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> This function has been redesigned in 7.2 FP2. The code sets a 
   <br /> much shorter timeout and repeats the query in smaller batches to 
   <br /> determine which endpoints are unresponsive. Whatever data is returned by 
   <br /> the queries is made available to TADDM. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> Feature 8; 
   <br /> ITM Scope Sensor Changes:
   <br /> 
   <br /> Documentation for the ITM Scope Sensor is updated and available from Tivoli Documentation Central at
   <br /> 
   <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/wikis/display/tivolidoccentral/Tivoli+Application+Dependency+Discovery+Manager">http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/wikis/display/tivolidoccentral/Tivoli+Application+Dependency+Discovery+Manager</a>.
   <br /> 
   <br /> Search for &quot;IBM Tivoli Monitoring Scope sensor&quot; in the Sensor Reference for 7.2 Sensor Interim Feature 1 and Fix Pack 2.
   <br /> 
   <br /> Highlights of the changes:
   <br /> 
   <br /> Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is no longer required on each ITM endpoint to be discovered. Target machine requirements are now:
   <br /> 
   <br /> 1. Windows discovery targets must have Microsoft .Net Framework 1.1 or later installed.
   <br /> 2 .Linux and UNIX systems must have a Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) compliant uuencode and uudecode commands installed.
   <br /> 
   <br /> Support bundle KD7 has an updated version string reflecting its current version: 072002000. The bundle is no longer required on Unix targets, only on Windows. Users must redeploy the latest KD7 bundle to all Windows endpoints. The KD7 bundle need not be removed from Unix targets.
   <br /> 
   <br /> The TEPS custom queries used by the sensor have changed. There are now 7 queries instead of 3. Follow the updated sensor reference instructions to install the new queries before attempting to run the sensor.
   <br /> 
   <br /> Other changes to the sensor include APAR and internal defect fixes to improve reliability and performance.

   <br /> Business Applications are not syncing fully to the Enterprise Domain, not all of the 
   <br /> components are copied across to the Enterprise Domain when running incremental syncs. 
   <br /> When a new component is added or deleted from an existing functional group in a Business 
   <br /> Application it is stored as an update in the change_history_table and Incremental Syncs 
   <br /> use the change_history_table to determine what needs to be synced from the last sync date. 
   <br /> However, Incremental Syncs only pick up Inserts and Deletes from the change_history_table

   <br /> Defects and Features included in this Fix Pack 7.2.0.0-TIV-ITADDM-FP0001 :
   <br /> 
   <br /> APAR IZ49943
   <br /> Sync DB error handling improvements. Handling has been added for the SQLExceptions
   <br /> generated when a Non Recoverable Chain Breaking exception is generated in DB2. 
   <br /> Similar Oracle exception will produce a similar result but the log message will be less specific.
   <br /> 
   <br /> APAR IZ59837 
   <br /> In the Switch Topology function of Analytics, when a Business Application/Business Service 
   <br /> is selected along with &quot;Show Hosts&quot;and/or &quot;Show Switches&quot;, no data is returned when the Run
   <br /> Report button is clicked, when a report type of &quot;switch&quot; is selected in the same function, 
   <br /> data is returned including the Business Application it belongs to.
   <br /> 
   <br /> APAR IZ60149 
   <br /> In the Product Console when a user tries to add the Custom server template from &quot;Unknown processes&quot; 
   <br /> view, the table &quot;Custom servers&quot; is not refreshing. This was happening because another table model 
   <br /> is used and the original is not synchronized
   <br /> 
   <br /> APAR IZ60336 
   <br /> In the Product Console, the button and the popup menu item for &quot;options&quot; dialog for Business 
   <br /> Application software infrastructure topology was not visible.
   <br /> 
   <br /> APAR IZ60340 
   <br /> In Change History report there are incorrect entries eg. an entry for a Computer System has in 
   <br /> its dependency tree other Computer System or AppServers or other objects that are not connected
   <br /> to given Computer System.
   <br /> 
   <br /> APAR IZ60683 
   <br /> It was discovered that the method of obtaining the serial Number from AIX was inefficient using lsconf 
   <br /> so this was changed to improve performance. A collation.properties entry was added to enable the 
   <br /> changed command to obtain the serial number: com.collation.platform.os.command.serialNumber.AIX. 
   <br /> The property is scoped and can be set at an IP level, eg: com.collation.platform.os.command.
   <br /> serialNumber.AIX.1.2.3.4=command.

   <br /> There is a problem with the delete method in the API. It can take a list of GUIDs but it will fail when 
   <br /> one of the GUIDs does not exist in the DB. It is not an error if object is not found so it should not stop 
   <br /> the remaining GUIDs from getting deleted. So the GUID that did not exist will be printed. The only change 
   <br /> is that it does not quit the delete method when a GUID is not found.

  <h2>Prerequisites</h2> 
  <div class="ibm-domino-rtf">
   <p>Before installing Fix Pack 006, you must have one of the following software already installed on the system: </p>
   <p><br /> • Tivoli Application Dependency Discovery Manager v7.2.0<br /> • Tivoli Application Dependency Discovery Manager v7.2.0 + FP1<br /> • Tivoli Application Dependency Discovery Manager v7.2.0 + FP2<br /> • Tivoli Application Dependency Discovery Manager v7.2.0 + FP3<br /> • Tivoli Application Dependency Discovery Manager v7.2.0 + FP4<br /> • Tivoli Application Dependency Discovery Manager v7.2.0 + FP5</p>
  </div>

 <div class="ibm-container-body"> 
  <h2>Installation Instructions</h2> 
  <div class="ibm-domino-rtf">
   <p>3.0. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:<br /> <br /> Upgrading to version 7.2.0 FP6<br /> <br /> Before upgrading Tivoli Application Dependency Discovery Manager (TADDM), check to ensure that your computing environment meets the requirements for each of the principal components of TADDM.<br /> <br /> <br /> 3.0.1. PERFORMING PREREQUISITE TASKS<br /> <br /> <b>*************************************NOTE***************************************</b><br /> <b>Please note if you have not already applied 7.2 FP2 then the following will affect you.</b><br /> <br /> <b>Fix Pack 002 incorporates new functionality to prepare for a future zVM DLA. As part of this change, the Fix Pack guid migration step will be deleting all ZVMGuests created by the Linux Sensor. This is required to ensure no duplicates are created post Fix Pack 002. IDML loaded zVMGuest objects are not affected, only discovered objects of this type and any children. These objects will need to be re-discovered after upgrade. Please plan the upgrade accordingly to ensure these deletes are non-disruptive.</b><br /> <b>********************************************************************************</b><br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 1. If the TADDM server is running, please stop the TADDM server before applying this fix pack. On<br /> Windows use the stopserver command(not control stop) to stop TADDM.<br /> <br /> <br /> 2. Use one of the following procedures to ensure all TADDM Server Java processes are stopped:<br /> <br /> - For Linux, Solaris, AIX, and Linux on System z operating systems, complete the following<br /> steps:<br /> a. Go to the %TADDM_HOME%/dist/bin directory.<br /> b. Enter the following command: ./control stop<br /> c. If all of the Java processes have not stopped after entering the ./control stop command<br /> and waiting an appropriate amount of time for the processes to shut down, use the<br /> process ID information provided by the ps command to identify and stop the running<br /> Java processes related to TADDM: ps -ef | grep java<br /> <br /> - For Window systems, use the Windows Task Manager to ensure that all TADDM Server Java<br /> processes are stopped (Including jservice.exe processes). Also please note that other non-<br /> TADDM services may run jservice.exe processes, these will also need to be stopped.<br /> <br /> <br /> 3. Create a backup of the database. To create a backup of a DB2 database, complete the <br /> following steps:<br /> <br /> a. Use one of the following procedures:<br /> <br /> - For Linux, Solaris, AIX, and Linux on System z operating systems, log in as the DB2 <br /> database instance owner. For example, you can use the db2inst1 ID.<br /> <br /> - For Windows operating systems, open the DB2CMD command prompt.<br /> <br /> b. Run the following command: <br /> db2 backup database cmdb <br /> <br /> Replace cmdb with the name of your database.<br /> <br /> If you use an Oracle database, refer to the Oracle documentation for instructions about how to <br /> backup the database.<br /> <br /> 4. Create a complete backup of the server files. Depending on the operating system, use the<br /> tar command to compress the entire directory. For Linux, Solaris, AIX, and Linux on System z <br /> operating systems, you want to use the tar command on the /opt/IBM/cmdb directory. For <br /> Windows operating systems, you want to use the zip command on the C:\ibm\cmdb directory.<br /> <br /> <br /> 5. (Optional) If you made changes to any of these files, save a copy of them: <br /> cmdb-context.xml file (ecmdb-context.xml if an enterprise TADDM)<br /> etc/EventConfig.xml <br /> etc/discover-sensors/*<br /> etc/sync/* <br /> etc/omnibus.eif.properties<br /> <br /> After the upgrade process is complete, you need to merge the contents of these backup files <br /> with the contents of the newly installed versions before starting the server.<br /> <br /> <br /> 6. For Windows systems please note the TADDM installer uses the TADDM Service to control<br /> the TADDM status, ensure TADDM is runnable as a service otherwise the installation may fail<br /> with:<br /> <br /> CTJT10203E The GUID migration fails because the Tivoli Application Dependency Discovery<br /> Manager Server did not start within a specified time...<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 3.0.2. UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS<br /> <br /> <b> *************************************NOTE*****************************************************</b><br /> <b> Please note unzipping the fixpack zip file can fail if the file is over 2GB in size. This is</b><br /> <b> a known zip bug and in order to resolve it Zip Ver 6 or higher needs to be installed.</b><br /> <b> </b><br /> <b> Latest sources and executables are at </b><b><u><a href="http://www.info-zip.org">http://www.info-zip.org</a></u></b><br /> <b> </b><b>*************************************************************************************************</b><br /> <br /> Before beginning the upgrade, verify that your system is running a supported operating system and<br /> that all hardware and software requirements are met. <br /> <br /> Also, if you use a TADDM Enterprise Domain Server, upgrade your TADDM Enterprise Domain <br /> Server before upgrading the TADDM Domain Server. You must upgrade the TADDM Enterprise <br /> Domain Server and all TADDM Domain Servers at the same time. You can use the following <br /> instructions to upgrade both the TADDM Domain Server and the TADDM Enterprise Domain <br /> Server.<br /> <br /> <br /> *** Please make sure that TADDM is stopped before starting this upgrade ***<br /> <br /> <br /> To upgrade the TADDM Server, complete the following steps:<br /> <br /> 1. Change to the TADDM Fix Pack directory<br /> <br /> 2. Use one of the following commands to run the upgrade process, replacing 'taddm_dir' with <br /> your TADDM directory and do not include dist in the path(example taddm_dir; /opt/IBM/cmdb):<br /> <br /> - For Linux, Solaris, AIX, and Linux on System z operating systems:<br /> <br /> To run the fix pack installation in GUI mode, type: <br /> ./installFixPack.sh taddm_dir<br /> <br /> To run the fix pack installation in console mode, type: <br /> ./installFixPack.sh taddm_dir -i CONSOLE<br /> <br /> To run the fix pack installation in silent mode, type:<br /> ./installFixPack.sh taddm_dir -i SILENT<br /> <br /> Please note in Silent mode information and error messages are not displayed on screen so <br /> after the install you must review the migration logs for errors.<br /> <br /> - For Windows operating systems:<br /> <br /> To run the fix pack installation in GUI mode, type:<br /> installFixPack.bat taddm_dir<br /> <br /> To run the fix pack installation in console mode, type:<br /> installFixPack.bat taddm_dir -i CONSOLE<br /> <br /> To run the fix pack installation in silent mode, type:<br /> installFixPack.bat taddm_dir -i SILENT<br /> <br /> Please note in Silent mode information and error messages are not displayed on screen so <br /> after the install you must review the migration logs for errors.<br /> <br /> 3. If the specified TADDM directory is version 7.2 , the installer prompts you for the upgrade. Click <br /> Next to proceed.<br /> <br /> 4. After the upgrade process is complete, a page indicating the status of the upgrade is displayed.<br /> Click Finish to close the upgrade program.<br /> <br /> 5. If you saved a backup copy of any files in step 5 (the &quot;Performing prerequisite tasks&quot; section),<br /> merge the contents of the backup copy with the contents of the new file that is installed as a <br /> part of the upgrade.<br /> <br /> If an error occurs during the upgrade, you can correct the problem and restart the TADDM <br /> installation process. The installation process resumes the upgrade process; you do not <br /> have to repeat any steps that were successfully completed.<br /> <br /> In the event the database upgrade fails after it is initialized, the database may need to be <br /> restored before resuming the upgrade. Contact Support if database upgrade problems are <br /> encountered.<br /> <br /> Locating Log Files<br /> The fix pack installer creates several log files in the installLogs directory during the upgrade:<br /> <br /> - Main log files:<br /> installLogs/taddm_7.2.0.6_install.log<br /> installLogs/taddm_7.2.0.6_install_msg.log<br /> <br /> - DB upgrade log files:<br /> dist/log/migration.log<br /> <br /> <br /> 6. Clearing the Java Web Start cache, after you install the server, you might have to clear the <br /> Java Web Start cache on each client system where you log in to the Product Console.<br /> <br /> To clear the Java Web Start cache, complete the following steps: <br /> <br /> a. Go to the directory where Java 1.5 is installed. <br /> <br /> b. Change to the \jre\bin directory.<br /> <br /> c. Double-click javaws.exe. <br /> 1. In the Java Application Cache Viewer window, click Edit &gt; Preferences. <br /> 2. In the Java Control panel, under the Temporary Internet Files section, click Delete Files, <br /> select all check boxes, and click OK.<br /> 3. Click OK.<br /> <br /> Also Domain Manager Users should clear their browser cache if they experience issues after<br /> installing the FP such as blank screens.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 7. If integrating TADDM with TBSM, CCMDB, or any other third party product please be sure to <br /> copy the necessary client jars to those installations. If ZVMGuests discovered by the Linux<br /> sensor existed in the database prior to the Fix Pack 006 upgrade, re-discover them and <br /> re-run any necessary integration scripts to ensure the changes are pulled into the third party<br /> product. The deletes and re-discovery of the ZVMGuests will be logged in change history.<br /> <br /> If TADDM-ITM integration (MOSWOS) is already installed on TADDM server, <br /> then the Customer needs to uninstall it and install it again after upgrading to 7.2<br /> <br /> Configuring ITM Scope Sensor for Fix Pack 6<br /> <br /> If you want to use ITM Scope Sensor with TADDM 7.2.0 you have to carry out following steps, due to changes in discovery target support bundle and custom queries SQL files. Now it is necessary to deploy KD7 bundle only to Windows discovery targets. Users must redeploy the latest KD7 bundle to all Windows endpoints. The KD7 bundle is no longer required on Unix targets. The KD7 bundle need not be removed from Unix targets.<br /> <br /> Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is no longer required on each ITM endpoint to be discovered. Target machine requirements are now:<br /> <br /> 1. Windows discovery targets must have Microsoft .Net Framework 1.1 or later installed.<br /> 2 .Linux and UNIX systems must have a Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) compliant uuencode and uudecode commands installed.<br /> <br /> <br /> Distributing the discovery target support bundle<br /> <br /> Before the first discovery from TADDM, the discovery target support bundle must be deployed onto each Tivoli Monitoring endpoint that is Windows operating system. <br /> <br /> <b> </b>Note: The discovery target support bundle has changed in Fix Pack 6 and should be redeployed to all Windows monitoring endpoints.<br /> <br /> The support bundle is in the KD7.zip or KD7_621.zip file in the /itm-discovery-support directory.<br /> The KD7.zip file should be used for the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server Version 6.2.2 FP2 or higher. The KD7_621.zip file should be used for the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server Version 6.2.1 FP1 or higher. <br /> <br /> To distribute the support bundle to the discovery targets, complete the following steps:<br /> <br /> 1. Extract the appropriate KD7.zip file into a directory on the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server (for example, the C:\TEMP directory on Windows and /tmp on Linux&reg; or UNIX&reg; system).<br /> 2. To distribute the support bundle to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server depot, run the tacmd command as user administrator, as shown in the following sample. To suppress the confirmation, use the -f option. <br /> <br /> On Windows operating system:<br /> <br /> C:\IBM\ITM\bin&gt;tacmd login -u sysadmin -p mypassword -s localhost<br /> <br /> Validating user...<br /> <br /> KUIC00007I: User sysadmin logged into server on <a href="https://localhost:3102">https://localhost:3102</a>.<br /> C:\IBM\ITM\bin&gt;tacmd addBundles -i C:\TEMP\KD7\072006000<br /> <br /> KUICAB023I: Are you sure you want to add the following bundles<br /> to the C:\IBM\ITM\CMS\depot\ depot?<br /> <br /> Product Code : D7<br /> Version : 072006000<br /> Description : TADDM Discovery through ITM enablement<br /> Host Type : WINNT<br /> Host Version : WINNT<br /> Prerequisites:<br /> <br /> KUICAB024I: Enter Y for yes or N for no: y<br /> <br /> KUICAB020I: Adding bundles to the C:\IBM\ITM\CMS\depot\ depot. <br /> The time required to complete this operation depends on the<br /> number and size of the added bundles.<br /> <br /> KUICAB022I: The following bundles were successfully added to the C:\IBM\ITM\CMS<br /> <br /> <br /> On Linux or UNIX operating system:<br /> <br /> [root@localhost bin]# /opt/IBM/ITM/bin/tacmd login -s localhost -u sysadmin -p &quot;teppass1&quot;<br /> <br /> Validating user...<br /> <br /> KUIC00007I: User sysadmin logged into server on <a href="https://localhost:3661">https://localhost:3661</a>.<br /> [root@localhost bin]# /opt/IBM/ITM/bin/tacmd addBundles -i /tmp/KD7/072006000/<br /> <br /> KUICAB023I: Are you sure you want to add the following bundles <br /> to the /opt/IBM/ITM/tables/TEMS/depot depot?<br /> <br /> Product Code : D7<br /> Version : 072006000<br /> Description : TADDM Discovery through ITM enablement<br /> Host Type : WINNT<br /> Host Version : WINNT<br /> Prerequisites:<br /> <br /> KUICAB024I: Enter Y for yes or N for no: y<br /> <br /> KUICAB020I: Adding bundles to the /opt/IBM/ITM/tables/TEMS/depot depot.<br /> The time required to complete this operation depends on the number and size<br /> of the added bundles.<br /> <br /> KUICAB022I: The following bundles were successfully added to the<br /> /opt/IBM/ITM/tables/TEMS/depot depot:<br /> <br /> 3. To distribute the support bundle from the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server to the discovery targets, log in to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server, and run the tacmd command, as shown in the following sample:<br /> <br /> tacmd login -u sysadmin -p mypassword -s localhost<br /> Validating user...<br /> KUIC00007I: User sysadmin logged into server on <a href="https://localhost:3102">https://localhost:3102</a>.<br /> <br /> tacmd addsystem -t d7 -n Primary:WINHOST:NT<br /> <br /> KUICAR010I: The agent type D7 is being deployed.<br /> <br /> KUICAR028I: The operation has been successfully queued for deployment, the transaction id<br /> is 1301348132141000000000041, use the getDeployStatus CLI to view the status.<br /> <br /> <br /> If running IBM Tivoli Monitoring Version 6.2.2 check the status of deployment by entering the tacmd getDeployStatus command. For example:<br /> <br /> tacmd getdeploystatus -g 1301348132141000000000041<br /> <br /> You may see the following error message: KDY0003E: The agent bundle D7 is already <br /> deployed to HUB_TEMS. An agent bundle cannot be deployed if it is already deployed.<br /> <br /> In this case, try tacmd updateagent command. For example:<br /> tacmd updateagent -t d7 -n Primary:WINHOST:NT<br /> <br /> <br /> Installing custom queries on the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server (Only to be applied if not already applied in FP2 or later).<br /> <br /> To support the lookup of managed system MAC addresses and agent versions by the IBM&reg; Tivoli&reg; Monitoring sensor, you must install custom queries on the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server.<br /> <br /> The custom queries are in the TEPS_Query.zip file in the /itm-discovery-support directory. The custom queries are defined now in only one SQL file (previously there were 3 SQL files):<br /> * install_zkd7.sql<br /> <br /> To install the custom queries on the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server, complete the following steps:<br /> <br /> Installing on Linux operating system:<br /> <br /> 1. Log in to the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, and copy the TEPS_Query.zip file to a <br /> local directory.<br /> <br /> In these instructions, the TEPS_Query.zip file is copied to the /tmp/teps directory and<br /> extracted. The install_zkd7.sql file is then located in the /tmp/teps directory.<br /> <br /> 2. Install the query:<br /> <br /> $CANDLEHOME/bin/itmcmd execute cq<br /> &quot;$CANDLEHOME/$BINARCH/cq/bin/KfwSQLClient -d KFW_DSN<br /> –f /tmp/teps/install_zkd7.sql&quot;<br /> <br /> 3. Stop the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server:<br /> <br /> $CANDLEHOME/bin/itmcmd agent stop cq<br /> <br /> 4. Start the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server:<br /> <br /> $CANDLEHOME/bin/itmcmd agent start cq<br /> <br /> Where:<br /> $CANDLEHOME is the ITM install directory<br /> $BINARCH is the directory for platform-specific binaries<br /> <br /> Installing on Windows&reg; operating system:<br /> <br /> 1. Log in to the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, and copy the TEPS_Query.zip file to a <br /> local directory.<br /> <br /> In these instructions, the TEPS_Query.zip file is copied to the c:\TEMP\TEPS <br /> directory and extracted. The install_zkd7.sql files are then located in the <br /> c:\TEMP\TEPS directory<br /> <br /> 2. Change to the directory where the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server is installed:<br /> <br /> cd c:\IBM\ITM\CNPS<br /> <br /> 3. Install the query:<br /> <br /> .\kfwsqlclient.exe /d KFW_DSN /f c:\TEMP\TEPS\install_zkd7.sql<br /> <br /> 4. From the Tivoli Monitoring Services window, restart the Tivoli Enterprise Portal <br /> Server.<br /> <br /> <br /> 8. Once the migration is complete you must update the database statistics using RUNSTATS for <br /> DB2 or DBMS_STATS for Oracle<br /> <br /> If you are using a DB2 database, see the DB2 database tuning topic in the TADDM <br /> Administrators Guide for more information. Also please note that for DB2 the db2updatestats.sh<br /> script must be run immediately after RUNSTATS completes.<br /> <br /> If you use an Oracle database, refer to the Oracle documentation for instructions about how to <br /> run DBMS_STATS.<br /> <br /> <br /> 9. Please note TADDM Fixpacks typically modify the WMI Provider (TaddmTool). When this occurs, the provider will be re-deployed to all Windows servers on the first discovery after the Fix Pack application. Re-deployment may require a WMI restart on the target. This can occur automatically depending on the value of com.collation.RestartWmiOnAutoDeploy in collation.properties.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 3.0.3. UPGRADING THE DATABASE MANUALLY<br /> <br /> The Fix Pack installation procedures above will upgrade the TADDM database to the current Fix<br /> Pack level. Normally customers do not need to manually upgrade the database. However, one can<br /> upgrade the database manually if your TADDM Server is at the current version, 7.2.0 FP6, but your <br /> TADDM Database is an earlier version of TADDM 7.2.0.<br /> <br /> These steps also may be required if the Fix Pack installation failed in the database steps. Please <br /> contact support if the database upgrade failed to confirm whether or not the DB must be restored <br /> before proceeding with a manual upgrade.<br /> <br /> If you are using a DB2 database, complete the following steps:<br /> <br /> 1. Log in as the DB2 database instance owner.<br /> <br /> 2. Run the following command:<br /> db2 reorgchk update statistics on table all &gt; reorg.out<br /> <br /> 3. In the reorg.out file, look in the reorg column for entries marked with a wildcard character. The<br /> wildcard character is an asterisk (*). For each line with a wildcard character, run the following<br /> command: db2 reorg table tablename db2 terminate<br /> <br /> If you use an Oracle database, refer to the Oracle documentation for instructions about how to <br /> reorganize the database.<br /> <br /> <br /> To manually upgrade the database, complete the following steps:<br /> <br /> 1. If it is running, stop the TADDM Server.<br /> <br /> 2. Change to the directory where the TADDM Server is installed. For example, the <br /> /opt/IBM/cmdb/dist/bin directory.<br /> <br /> 3. Use one of the following procedures to upgrade the database:<br /> <br /> - To upgrade for Linux, Solaris, AIX, or Linux on System z operating systems, run the following<br /> command: <br /> ./migration.sh -s -bv 7.2<br /> <br /> - To upgrade for Windows operating systems, run the following command:<br /> ./migration.bat -s -bv 7.2<br /> <br /> 4. Verify that no errors occurred by checking the appropriate log file:<br /> <br /> - For Linux, Solaris, AIX, or Linux on System z operating systems,<br /> $COLLATION_HOME/log/migration.log<br /> <br /> - For Windows operating systems, <br /> %COLLATION_HOME%\log\migration.log<br /> <br /> 5. Start the TADDM Server. Wait for the server to start. The server status must be running before you<br /> start the next step.<br /> <br /> If an error occurred, fix the problem and rerun the script. If no errors occurred, go to the next step.<br /> <br /> <br /> 6. Use one of the following procedures to perform the GUID migration:<br /> <br /> - To upgrade for Linux, Solaris, AIX, or Linux on System z operating systems, run the following<br /> 2 commands: <br /> <br /> -- update guid by class<br /> ./migration.sh -gc -bv 7.2<br /> <br /> -- update guid by id<br /> ./migration.sh -gi<br /> <br /> <br /> - To upgrade for Windows operating systems, run the following 2 commands: <br /> <br /> -- update guid by class<br /> ./migration.bat -gc -bv 7.2<br /> <br /> -- update guid by id<br /> ./migration.bat -gi<br /> <br /> <br /> 7. Use one of the following procedures to upgrade the database templates:<br /> <br /> - To upgrade for Linux, Solaris, AIX, or Linux on System z operating systems, run the following<br /> command: <br /> ./migration.sh -t -bv 7.2<br /> <br /> - To upgrade for Windows operating systems, run the following command: <br /> ./migration.bat -t -bv 7.2<br /> <br /> 8. Use one of the following procedures to upgrade sensor configurations:<br /> <br /> - To upgrade for Linux, Solaris, AIX, or Linux on System z operating systems, run the following <br /> command:<br /> ./migration.sh -sc<br /> <br /> - To upgrade for Windows operating systems, run the following command:<br /> ./migration.bat -sc<br /> <br /> 9. Verify that no errors occurred by checking the appropriate log file:<br /> <br /> - For Linux, Solaris, AIX, or Linux on System z operating systems,<br /> $COLLATION_HOME/log/migration.log<br /> <br /> - For Windows operating systems, <br /> %COLLATION_HOME%\log\migration.log<br /> <br /> If an error occurred, fix the problem and rerun the script. If no errors occurred, migration is <br /> complete.<br /> <br /> <br /> See &quot;7.0. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:&quot; for additional steps that you might need to do in your <br /> environment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4.0. UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:<br /> <br /> <br /> The rollback process is different depending on the operating system. The instructions in this section <br /> assume that the default installation location was used. If you used a different location when installing <br /> and upgrading your server, substitute that path for the paths indicated in this section. <br /> <br /> To roll back the server from a Windows computer, complete the following steps: <br /> <br /> 1.
