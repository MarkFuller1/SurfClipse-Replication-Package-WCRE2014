An advanced topics Lisp book, mostly about macros and closures.  I was going to
put this off until the end of my Lisp self-education, but it was the best
portable hard copy book I had lying around, so I was reading it on the Metro
since I had a commute for awhile.

Gets into a lot more advanced detail than is useful for me at the moment, like
low level optimizations.  If I come back to writing CL regularly, I'll reread
this.  This did give me a few new macro usage ideas and I'll probably use the
custom hygienic macro definition macro.

I may have some ideas about graph algorithms applied to distributed computing,
which is a large part of my job.  Pregel established the base concepts used in
Apache Hama and the now defunct GoldenOrb (replaced by Giraph).

This isn't that complicated.  Figure 2 pretty much illustrates how an algorithm
would execute.  Also to keep in mind are aggregators and topology mutation.

Was hoping this could be a refresher of some basics and a good chance to make
sure I've internalized everything.  However, I read some of this and it's
pretty lame.  The CS here is minimal and it's mainly a Python tutorial.

<span class="org-link">http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english2e/</span>

Plowed through this pretty quick and ignored the GASP library stuff.  Not
bothering to do the exercises since they're all pretty trivial.  I'm also not
crazy about the random mashing of CS and SE concepts.

I did learn a couple things:
- `<span class="org-footnote">[0]</span> * 4' initializes a list of zeros of length 4.
- `[1, 2] * 2' evaluates to [1, 2, 1, 2].

Work-related reading as a prerequisite to implementing the Louvain algorithm on

Not too complicated on its surface.  Doing this in Giraph might be a challenge
though, since it's not immediately obvious to me how this algorithm would
decompose/map into Giraph tasks (or whatever they're called).  I'm also not
sure what's meant here by the "modularity" of nodes in communities.

Already did the exercises for a lot of this, but it was years ago, so starting
over.  This is really a good tutorial (with a few minor exceptions).

Since a lot of content is still missing from this (looks like it's not done
yet), I'll have to supplement this with some other Haskell text afterwards, but
that was my plan anyway.  There's some things I'm not sure about though, like
the CPS style is wrong, I think.  Code in practice/haskell/yaht.

I'm skipping the final chapter, but I may come back and do it later.

<span class="org-link">http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36632.html</span>

Notes:
- Dremel uses a columnar data model.  Records are either atomic values or
  records that contain some number of required or optional fields.  Some fields
  can be repeated, meaning they can many entries.
- A dotted notation is used for references records/fields.
- Repetition levels are necessary to disambiguate columns.  They are indexed by
  "at what repeated field in the field's path the value has repeated."  NULLs
  are inserted when a repeated field doesn't include another field that
  contains the same required field.  The definition levels inform how many
  potentially undefined fields in that path are actually defined.  A bit
  confusing, but can be worked out with some effort, though in practice it
  requires extra info.
- The efficiency is gained in the fact that record assembly only occurs upon
  needed fields.  These are reconstructed using FSMs.

Columnar data models seem to have a serious downside in visually inspecting
what you actually have in your data.  Algorithms like those provided in the
appendices are needed to do anything in such a system.  This complexity can be
outweighed in performance, particularly in sparse datasets with lots of fields.

what NaNs are, what inf is, and all the things these imply.  After reading this
paper, you'll know why a == a + 1.0 can be true, why a==a can be false, why
running your code on two different machines can give you two different answers,
why summing numbers in a different order can give you an order of magnitude
difference and all the wacky stuff that happens in the world of mapping an
uncountably infinite set of numbers onto a countably finite set."

Notes:
- The IEEE floating-point standards provides algorithms for basic math
  operations with answers that implementations are required to match.  If
  designing systems, it'd be a good idea to check against them.
- 0.1 base 10 cannot be exactly stored in base 2 (1.10011001... * 2^-4).
- Various methods for rewriting algorithms exist to accommodate rounding
  errors.  An example is given here.
- The IEEE floating-point standards are IEEE 754 for binary and IEEE 854 for
  base 2 and 10.
- Base 2 implementations benefit from tighter error analyses, as base is a
  factor in relative error.
- NaN is represented by floating-point numbers with exponent max(e) + 1 and
  nonzero significands, zero by exponent min(e) - 1 and zero significand.

Practically, the issues here are indeed things a programmer or computer
scientist should always be keeping in mind, as floating-point computation can
introduce small "relative errors" that cascade to "catastrophic" value errors.
For language design, obviously try to meet the IEEE standards (probably not a
problem if there's a standard host language).

I'm considering getting into handloading as a hobby once I move out of DC.  The
main reason is to be able to use some esoteric cartridges, as there are few
good off the shelf rifle-like cartridges optimized for short barrels.  It also
looks like it might be fun.  However, I'm a bit put off by how much stuff I'd
have to own to do this.  So, I haven't decided yet, but reading the informative
(non-chart data) chapters of this should give me an insight into the effort
involved and is just good info to know.  If I do decide to get into this, get
an updated version of this book.

An okay read, but actually didn't learn much since I'm somewhat familiar with
the basics.  This copy is very old, so it doesn't even include most of the
newer cartridges I'd be interested in.

There's only a few other interesting post-manifesto points in here.  Kaczynksi
also seems to repeat himself often and engage in a lot of rather uninteresting
rambling.  A lot of this reads like an internal dialog within the
anarcho-primitivism movement, which of course isn't something I care about.
Overall, I'm unimpressed and more convinced than ever that my counter-arguments

<span class="org-link">http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2274/2274-h/2274-h.htm</span>

Also read some of the cited works, like Hazlitt's "On Poetry in General".

There's some good content here and I seem to have independently discovered most
of these ideas.  Some notes:
- I've lately started to feel more in agreement with something pointed out here
  about fiction: "[...] the reason is that bad novels ought not to be read, and
  that good novels never demand any appreciable mental application on the part
  of the reader."
- I'm not sure I agree with his later assertion about there being a mental
  benefit to reading classic literature that is difficult to parse or is
  written in verse.  If I'm going to really struggle reading, I'd rather it be
  to learn something useful.  However, I've queued his main suggestion of
  reading Aurora Leigh in an attempt to find out for sure.  I suspect this
  would be more true for one developing reading skills.
- I like his idea about training your brain to focus better by forcing it to
  stay on topic for set periods of time.  My approach here has been to remove
  distractions, but this could be a useful method when that's not possible.
- Includes a reminder that quantity of books read is unimportant.  He suggests
  45 min of reflection for every 90 min of reading, which I think is a bit
  too much on average.

A Roger Penrose book that presents the fundamental laws of the universe, with
much mathematical information intact.  I'm mainly interested in this for the
first section, which is intended to get the reader at least acquainted enough
with the relevant math to understand the physics, but I'll read the rest of it
too (minus the stuff on twistor theory, which I already read about in The
Emporer's New Mind and am at least tentatively dismissing).

This book doesn't meet its stated goal of being for intelligent
non-professionals.  Even being a layman of somewhat above average mathematical
skill, I found much of this impenetrable.  While this has helped identify some
shortcomings, a better approach could have managed the state of the reader's
learning as well.  I would've gladly exchanged scope for a more carefully built
foundation.  I'm stopping a few chapters in and will revisit this later once
I've done more remedial work on my own, as plowing ahead with it in confusion
isn't an optimal use of energy.

I've read older versions of this, but want to read the current version since
I'm upgrading to 9.1 and want to use the current best sysadmin practices.

Notes:
- chflags can do things like set a flag on a file such that it cannot be
  deleted.  This might have its uses, but I'm a bit wary of having to manage
  extra metadata on files.
- Consider different settings for various filesystems.  For example, I might
  want /home to be nosuid.  noexec could also be useful (like for /tmp or
  /var).  Full options are in mount(8).

Most of this is the same, but a lot of sysadmin stuff has been improved.
Created separate tasks for the replacement utilities and documented stuff in my
9.1 setup document.  Read most of this, but skipped much of the stuff I don't
use, since the main point of this task is now achieved.

Read the city code document available on the city government site.  Will skip
some of the parts that don't apply to me, since it's pretty long.

Property tax in the surrounding Frederick county is 0.51%, versus the
Winchester rate of 0.95%.

This is less offensive of a city code than other places I've lived, but it's
still beyond my tolerance level.  I definitely won't be buying any property
within city limits, at least to actually live in, mainly due to the standard
assortment of required responsibilities (lawn care, snow removal, taxes).
However, there are some very minor benefits offered by the city for registered
technology businesses that may be worth exploring if the occasion arises.

I'd long been aware of this popular philosophy book, but decided to pass on it
until recommended enthusiastically by a coworker.

Quitting this about a third in.  There's some serious problems here:
- The existence of infinite hypotheses doesn't imply the scientific method is
  flawed.  It just means we need external criteria for prioritizing them.  This
  already happens.
- This book is part autobiography, and a very boring one at that.  Maybe this
  is okay to help a general audience relate, but I'd rather just read the main
  point, which I later did on Wikipedia.
- Like a typical philosophic tract, this is full of unreasoned assertions.
- Lots of Eastern mysticism nonsense.
- The underlying model of "metaphysics of Quality" is stupid.  Reading it
  without its verbal fluff on Wikipedia illustrates this clearly.

This isn't all bad, but the okay parts are mostly just self-help and
observations on human behavior.

Another Michael Flynn hard scifi novel.

This is more of a character study -- something I've never seen a good example
of.  The scifi elements here are okay, but are too sparse to maintain my
interest.  Quit about 12% in and just read the ending, which wasn't that great
either.

Another Michael Flynn novel.

There's some decent writing here, but it's interspersed between two types of
really crappy writing.  One is predictable, trope-fest action scenes.  The
other is just mindless filler about mundane things that have no relation to the
story (likely backfilled in to pad the length).  Also, despite being well
researched in some areas, really dumb errors are made in others (e.g.,
revolvers don't have safeties).  I'd have preferred a little more believable
fictitious math too, as what's here isn't convincing.

The only other Poul Anderson book which looks interesting.

I'd divide this book into two parts.  One is the past, which is very well
researched and believable.  After an awkward segue into the future, it turns
into a just standard hard scifi read.  This was still okay, but nothing
special and could have benefited from more work.

A hard scifi novelist recommended by /r/printSF.  I had already tried reading
Bloom long ago though, and didn't like it.
- Boundary Condition: Okay.
- How the Bald Apes Saved Mass Crossing: Entertaining.
- Garbage Day: Not bad, but it seems the Queendom of Sol setting this takes
  place in may only be interesting for character development and such.  I'll
  probably pass on it as a result.
- Heisenberg Elementary: Meh.
- The Technetium Rush: Crap.

I'll probably try one or two of his longer novels.  He's capable of good
writing but occasionally chooses topics poorly, it seems.

A Robert Sawyer novel about an internet sentience.  Has some potentially dumb
story features.

Apparently the author is confused about what the difference is between the web

of this trilogy and all other works by this author (who apparently can't keep
his novels from turning into leftist political screeds).

Another nanotechnology scifi novel by the hit-or-miss Greg Bear.  Hopefully
another good exploration of the potential for technology to change just about
everything (though in this case, it's supposedly apocalyptic).  Bear's few
excellent works have been good enough for me to at least try anything that
sounds promising of his.

An excellent novel in almost every way.  A thoroughly original concept (or at
least unique to me) and well-researched enough to be educational too.  I'd say
its only minor weakness is including the concept of observation creating
reality at the macro scale.

The T.S. Eliot poem often assigned for analysis by English majors.  Cited by
Wikipedia as being called "one of the most important poems of the 20th
century."

Very Ezra Pound-like.  Needlessly and intentionally obscurantist, which
explains its popularity for keeping students busy.  There is some okay imagery
in a few parts here, I guess, but if the goal is to transfer information of
some kind to the reader, it fails miserably.  Also noticed this is where the
title for the novel "Consider Phlebas" came from.  Didn't get anything out of
reading this.

A biology hard scifi novel series by Greg Bear.
- Darwin's Radio: Contains some well researched and even somewhat educational
  science.  Apart from that, this is mostly not that great.  None of the
  characters are interesting enough for a character-centric story like this.
  Making matters worse, dull minutia of their everyday lives is described in
  great detail (probably just as page count fodder).  Actual plot progression
  is incredibly slow partly as a result, but also because just not that much
  interesting stuff happens.
- Darwin's Children: Has all the problems of the former text, but worse.  Has
  some annoying political commentary.  I regret reading this series.

Recommended in How to Live on Twenty-Four Hours a Day as an example of a work
which, when read, develops ones mental faculties -- unlike normal good fiction:

"There is an infinitely finer English novel, written by a woman, than anything
by George Eliot or the Brontes, or even Jane Austen, which perhaps you have not
read. Its title is "Aurora Leigh," and its author E.B. Browning. It happens to
be written in verse, and to contain a considerable amount of genuinely fine
poetry. Decide to read that book through, even if you die for it. Forget that
it is fine poetry. Read it simply for the story and the social ideas. And when
you have done, ask yourself honestly whether you still dislike poetry."

I've been meaning to give an epic novel/poem like this a new try, so this is as
good as any.  If I like this writing style, I may try Paradise Lost, which the
author of the essay suggests next.  If I find this a waste of time, I can
safely get rid of several printed books in the same genre.

<span class="org-link">http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/barrett/aurora/aurora.html</span>

Excellent writing which would be far more digestible in prose form.  Had to
quit early due to the actual content being conveyed being an uninteresting
emotional narrative of the "journey of life" variety.  This is great at what
it's trying to do, but I've already experienced such chronicles too many times
for one so fundamentally unremarkable to appeal to me.  On the contrary to the
cited essay, this is a perfect example of why to avoid female-authored classic
literature, particularly that from England.

As for the original goal of reading this, I guess you could use intentionally
abstruse text to hone your information extraction skill, but why not apply that
effort reading something both challenging to understand and useful (or
entertaining)?  The only secondary benefit in this example is expanding one's
vocabulary or perhaps appreciation of well-crafted text.  So, I certainly don't
think there's anything inherently beneficial about poetry, particularly given
it's many downsides as a form of communication.  I also still think the
pinnacle of writing to be the judicious application of finely honed authoring
skills -- that is, its application in a manner that substantively adds to the
content.  Here, the talent is wasted, bloating an otherwise insubstantial
narrative with a profusion of sentimental blather.

Overall a good read.  A fair amount of well-researched science, a plausible
back story, decent (but not great) writing, and a mostly believable plot.
Probably the weakest link was the main characters, who were a bit dull to read
so much character development about.  I would have also been happy to pass on
the love triangle and other romance.

This series has potential since it's a space exploration saga that doesn't
primarily use space ships.  I've suspected that interstellar travel (if
possible) may not necessarily require ships (though I also have other notions
that travel at all may not be something prioritized by such a civilization or
even that "civilization" should be assumed).  This series is followed by the
"Void Trilogy", which I'll consider after finishing.

- Misspent Youth: Not officially part of this saga, but provides some of the
  back-story on its universe.  Skipping due to it being a completely
  character-centric novel.  Just read the Wikipedia entry plot summary.
- Pandora's Star: Very long, but filled with good content.  There's some less
  interesting stuff in here too (mostly about personal relationships), but the
  good outweighs the bad.  This does also include a fair amount of ship-based
  space travel, but it's handled fairly well.
- Judas Unchained: Less well written than the first part.  Too many fast-paced

While occasionally talented, this author's failings appear to be introducing
fantasy elements (transrealism), comedy that only sometimes works, and an
obsession with gays and drugs.

Having read a few Stephenson books now, I'm not sure his writing style is for
me.  I think I'll make this one my last real attempt at his stuff.  This is
supposedly the best of his works, so if I can't stomach it, then I'll be
writing him off for good.

A thoroughly excellent book and well researched.  A lot of thought went into
structuring this novel and it shows.  I may give Cryptonomicon a try as a
result.

- Daemon: Great concept, only okay execution.  Problems include too much
  action, unrealistically competent government employees (balanced somewhat by
  their failure, but only when at odds with a much more competent force),
  uninteresting characters, and a few (minor) technical errors.  Still a decent

This is just a general upgrade of MB, CPU, RAM, vidcard, disk, and OS.
Switching OS to Win7 Home Premium (the downside is a 16GB RAM max, but has way
less overhead overall).  This is part of my ultimate computing setup task and
provided nothing breaks, I'll be keeping this setup for at least 6 years and
hopefully longer if I keep it off when not using it.  I'll keep the fanless
vidcard in case the new one (which has a fan) dies.

This came together nicely and the performance improvements were worth it.  The
only minor downsides were that none of the 2.5"-&gt;3.5" adapters I had fit the
case's HDD slots and apparently MBs don't come with IDE adapters anymore so I
had to also buy a SATA DVD drive for $17.

This is an alternative to the pkg_tools on FreeBSD.  Like those, it only deals
with binary packages and overall package management.  Using this has a few
benefits as I see it:
- Consolidates all the pkg_tools commands under one command.
- Includes built in security auditing, negating the need for portaudit.
- It's probably what will become standard as 10.x defaults to this (I think).

Usage notes:
- Bootstrap the pkg system by running `/usr/sbin/pkg' as root.
- Convert the pkg_tools database to pkgng by running `pkg2ng'.
- Delete /var/db/pkg.bak, if it exists.
- Edit /etc/make.conf and add (with a tab before yes): WITH_PKGNG=    yes

Like pkg_tools, I won't install anything through this.

Now I can safely forget about cvsup.

This replaces the need to manually apply patches when updating the system.  I
still want to build a custom kernel, so I'll just use it to update the source
tree and userland.

During my normal install procedure, I would manually rebuild userland and the
kernel twice to get the latest patches in before installing any ports.  This
procedure can now change to leaving the default settings in
/etc/freebsd-update.conf which includes the line `Components src world kernel'
and running the update.  After that, I'll remove the kernel part.

portmanager is non-functional with pkgng.  Apparently no one was maintaining
it.  portmaster seems like it might be an acceptable alternative.

Usage notes:
- Install ports-mgmt/portmaster.  Flag for PKGNGPATCH and ZSH.
- Check for newer ports: portmaster -L
- Upgrade everything: portmaster -a
- Upgrade everything with prompts: portmaster -ai
- Install a port, upgrading dependencies: portmaster shells/bash

`portmaster -L' also categorizes all ports into various groups.  Looking at
the leaf and root ports serves the same purpose as `portmanager -sl' did.

This is probably a better port management utility than portmanager, as it's way
faster and the command flags are more intuitive.

Gauche is broken in ports now.  The interpreter is actively maintained, so it's
probably the maintainer's fault.  However, since I do need a working Scheme
interpreter, I'll find something else to use in the meantime and maybe stick
with this alternative.

Switched to scm.  Installing lang/scm and lang/slib seems to work fine.  Emacs
integration works.  Unless I encounter some issues with it while writing code,
I may just stick with this from now on.

Not sure I'm sold on this idea, but it's potential benefits make it worth

Looked into this some.  The main features, and the reasons I don't need eev for
those purposes, are:
- Recording shell sessions: I use shell scripts for this.
- Referring to other documents: I can use Emacs bookmarks for this.
- Demos: Don't do demos.

This is simpler than I thought.  I can see it being useful in some situations,
but it's not worth the cost for me.

A possible replacement for SLIME and swank-clojure.  This can also act as a
front end for multiple Lisps (the swank-clojure maintainer confirmed my
suspicions that it was simply not possible to have both functional with SLIME).
This is still not quite at feature parity with SLIME, so I may restore my SBCL
SLIME setup for now and just use nrepl for Clojure.  Look into lein-nrepl while
I'm at it and convert all projects over to this.  Probably will require
Marmalade to pull in dependencies, unless I want to do that manually.

<span class="org-link">https://github.com/kingtim/nrepl.el</span>

This is actually slower than SLIME on my n270; to the point of being unusable.

Emacs 24.x and FreeBSD 9.2 are now released, meaning it's time to do an
upgrade.  I was going to do a source upgrade, but I got a spare SSD of similar
specs so I can revert back in the event of something serious being broken.
10.0 is coming out in a month or two though, so I may wait for that.

Tasks:
- Read the new install procedure in the handbook.
- Setup 9.2 on a VM and run through the process, updating my install document.
- Backup all stuff off cellblock.  rsync everything to muze if there's enough
  space.  Also scp the entire FS to my backup drive (just in case).
- Replace the SSD and do the install.
- Spend a lot of time on the new kernel build.  Check the Hardware
  Compatibility List for 9.2 (sometimes there's useful hints in here).

Changes since 8.0 are the most drastic I've seen in a long time.  The new
system administration utilities are all improvements with far less cognitive
overhead and allow me to delete a ton of scripts.  The main downside is that a
lot more disk is used (though this is mainly a result of more bloat in ports).
Overall, I'd trade the gig or two in space for the improvements, but the
trade-off should be unnecessary.

Only did the VM, since 10.0 is coming out very soon.

- No need to backup or sync website content manually or by script.
- Ability to check out the site and edit it as normal user.
- Reduced need to edit anything as root.

However, I do have to keep in mind that everything behind the scenes will now
be world-viewable.  Make sure there's no personal info or passwords anywhere.

Notes:
- Excluding cgi-bin for now.
- To switch a repo to ssh, edit .git/config and change the "origin" URL to
  something like ssh://git@github.com/user/project.git.  When creating a new

Trying to use R for the developing statistical learning models used at work.  R
may also be handy later for backend integration with various parts of
applications.  R is a flawed language though, so I'm targeting only a practical
level of usefulness.  I'm quite alright with sucking at R, and if I don't get
through all of this by retirement, that's fine with me.

Setup notes:
- Available on FreeBSD in math/R.  Change build options to include LETTER_PAPER
  and PDF_MANUALS.
- Unfortunately, this pulls in a full stack of packages for an updated gcc
  version. :\
- Build lang/gcc45 dependency without Java frontend.
- Setup ESS (already added to .emacs and ~/.emacs.d/ess).
- In some Linuxes, the R package is often called r-base.

Tasks:
- Learn some basic R. (DONE)
- Setup ESS. (DONE)
- Read the online R manual: <span class="org-link">http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.html</span>
- Choose a book to read on R.  Someone at work suggested the O'Reilly book, "R
  In a Nutshell", but I don't have a copy, so unless I buy one, reading
  "Introductory Statistics with R".
- Check out bnlearn and other Bayesian network R packages.
- Make an R script to collect all my add-on packages.
- Maybe read the rest of the R docs at: <span class="org-link">http://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html</span>
- Check out igraph.
- Consider ggplot2 for graphs.

Installing this on my work VMs so as not to muck up my home machine.

Update: I'm going to try to get away without learning this.  From what I know
of R so far, it's a pretty ugly language, statistics bore me, packages too
often don't work and require much manual labor, and I'm pretty sure it doesn't
have a future with me post-work due to the bloated dependencies.

Distributed graph processing.  Looked at some code for this, and it's ugly.  I
suspect that it's a bloated, sub-optimal solution to solving graph problems,
but I'm not aware of any alternatives at the moment (apart from other libraries
very similar to this).  I've already read the Pregel paper for some context, so
just read whatever docs are available on the Giraph site.  Maybe make a sample
program.

This works, but is extremely awkward and time-consuming.  It also is very rough
around the edges.

Gave up on this.  Modern Java development frustrates me too much.

This is a concept around which things like Pregel, Apache Hama, and Apache

processing algorithm.  I've been skeptical of it some due to the overhead
involved, but apparently it does scale well in the real world if you structure
your problems correctly.

I guess I pretty much get how this works now.

A graph theory concept used in the various graph analytics.

Centrality is the relative importance of a vertex within a graph.  There are
several other types of centrality besides betweeness.  Degree centrality is the
"default".  Betweeness centrality is the measure of the number of shortest
paths from all vertices to all others that pass between that vertex.

Apparently being already Lisp-literate makes this pretty easy.

The plan:
- Read A Brief Beginner's Guide To Clojure (online).
- Read Clojure - Functional Programming for the JVM (online).
- Do UPenn Clojure exercises (online).
- Read Clojure Programming.  This unfortunately lacks exercises (like all
  Clojure books I considered).
- Due to no exercises, do all of: <span class="org-link">https://www.4clojure.com/problems</span>
- Write some kind of actual mini-project in the language.
- Read everything on the Clojure main site.
- Look at the Clojure Contrib projects:
  <span class="org-link">http://dev.clojure.org/display/doc/Clojure+Contrib</span>
- Keep this cheatsheet handy: <span class="org-link">http://clojure.org/cheatsheet</span>
- Reference this site for examples/docs: <span class="org-link">http://clojuredocs.org/</span>

Notes:
- ring is probably the most popular webapps library:
  <span class="org-link">https://github.com/mmcgrana/ring</span>
- For a Clojure-specific pastebin, use: <span class="org-link">https://refheap.com/paste</span>
- Some things seem more complex in Clojure vs. Lisp.  For example, this in CL:
  (let ((count 0)) (defun counter () (incf count)))
  is equivalent to this in Clojure:
  (let [count (ref 0)] (defn counter [] (dosync (alter count inc))))

Resigning the job means I don't necessarily need Clojure anymore.  However, I
may still complete this task on my own terms.  I like most things about
Clojure, but there are exceptions:
- Clojure stacktraces are the same mess that Java's are.
- Much stuff in Clojure is just a wrapper around Java code.  In most Lisps, you
  can just navigate into the underlying Lisp code all the way to primitives.
- Java interop is ugly and un-Lispy.
- It's often painfully slow.
- Some of the Clojure ecology of libraries resemble Java ones in that they have
  way too many dependencies.

This will probably be a little harder than learning Clojure, but I'm countering
that by not going as deep on it (due to lack of interest and it not being as
nice of a language).  Though this is work-driven, there is some residual
benefit here, as ML-variant literacy is on my list of things to have.

The plan:
- Redo Scala Emacs setup.
- Read Programming Scala (2nd ed.).
- Read the sbt manual.
- Read the ENSIME manual.
- Write some projects in Scala.  I'd like to at least do one test project using
  Scalding, preferably one of the ones I've already done in Cascalog to compare
  performance and ease of use.
- Decide how much, if at all, I want to stick with the language/ecology.

through the remaining and start each one up and delete anything I don't want to

Most arcade games are button-mashing spaz-fests, so I was able to get rid of
the vast majority of them, leaving 92 roms of total size 900MB.

I may do the same later with other romsets, all of which I've already created
first pass subsets of.  If I could get my complete rom collection down to a few
GB, that would go a long way towards my data size goals.

Supposedly the most refined Spiderweb Software game to date.  Was on sale for a
few dollars on Steam so it seemed like a good opportunity to finally experience
one and see if their fanbase's loyalty is justified.

This game is just okay.  It has some good points and acceptable graphics, but a
lot of downsides:
- Classes and character development are too simplified.
- Skill trees are very small and restrictive.
- Not enough item choices.  In fact, you really don't have any gear choices to
  make since the best one is always obvious and each class really only has
  predefined play-styles.
- Practically non-existent RP value outside of the occasional minor dialog
  choice.
- Boring, uninspired story and game world that borrows so heavily from various
  tropes that it's completely generic.
- Combat is repetitive and too simple.  Most encounters are just trash mobs
  that charge at you until dying.
- Environment is too non-interactive.

The annotated maps are rather useful when playing so as not to lose track of
quest givers: <span class="org-link">http://avadonannotatedmaps.zxq.net/index.html</span>

I guess it's not a bad deal for $3, but there are more interesting games that
are completely free.  Playing this just feels like a waste of entertainment
time.  Ended up quitting this after getting to the second main area.  I may one
day come back and finish it but will definitely skip future installments.

The stolen and reworked codebase for what was to be Lineage 3.  Will just fr00b
it up for a few evenings, then call it done.  I definitely don't actually want
to grind in a modern MMO, but if you pretend the extent of the game is just the
early levels, they're okay provided you possess the discipline to quit when the
time comes.

Played an antlerface mystic for awhile, but only managed to stomach it for a
few hours.  This game has a lot of problems, but the main issue (for me) is the
manual aiming and dodging, which requires way more cognitive overhead than it
should.  Compared to more passively-played MMOs, you do a lot more work for
very little extra game experience.  Apart from that, it's mostly just yet
another boring modern WoW/EQ-clone with standard Asian MMORPG tropes.

Played this a little back in 2005, but will start over and make a proper
attempt at beating it.  Space Rangers: Reboot only costs a few dollars and
includes the expansion pack, but I'll just play the normal game for now.

After installing, edit cfg.txt and change the RobotResolution to 1920,1200.
This only affects the RTS mini-games and also causes crashing if changing
options in game.

This is an okay game, but has some problems:
- The graphics aren't terrible but the color palette makes my eyeballs bleed.
  The user interface would probably look less appalling if it were higher
  resolution and didn't have randomly arranged buttons.
- Installs Starforce.  I installed the game normally, overwrote the binary with
  a no-CD one, then ran the Starforce removal utility.  However, it says the
  driver isn't installed.  So, it's either hiding somewhere, Starforce doesn't
  support 2k8r2, or the utility doesn't support removal on 2k8r2.
- The arcade-like wormhole mini-game isn't any fun (for me).  If I wanted to
  play an action game, I'd not be playing a mostly TBS game.  I usually just
  save scum them, letting the autopilot do the work.
- Has mostly uninspired writing and game lore.  Poor translation is everywhere.
- I'd prefer space flight was a bit more realistic.  Planets are too close
  together, asteroids zoom around like in an arcade game, and planets orbit
  their suns in a few weeks.  Obviously this isn't a sim, but some relation to
  reality would've made it more fun for me.
- NPCs can target and begin firing mid-turn, but the player can't.
- You have to keep up with an item/ship treadmill.  This actually isn't too
  hard, but I'd prefer at least a slightly more static universe given how much
  of a pain it is to collect/mod proper gear.
- The economy is completely imbalanced.  Trading becomes pointless once you get
  some okay gear.
- Repair costs are insane.  You can carefully mod certain n00b gear you pick up
  early to help this, but you have to get lucky on micromodules.
- There's no grand strategy against the antagonists.  You just take back and
  defend systems and others randomly fall.  Eventually, the balance shifts in
  your favor.  It takes forever, which would be fine, except that the space
  combat here gets very repetitive.  A more interesting setup would be having
  tough enemy core systems surrounded by less defended ones, and these empires
  expand/contract based upon player and NPC ranger/military actions.
- I'd rather have a better core game experience (trading and space
  flight/combat) than all these mini-games which are just crappier versions of
  genres done better elsewhere.

After getting familiar with the game's quirks, I played for several nights and
got to the #2 ranking, but then lost the desire to keep going.  The most
frustrating part of this game is that it could be quite awesome if it just
didn't have a few fundamental flaws.  I'm sure I can win with my current run,
but there's less depressing gaming experiences to be had.  I'll back up my
saves, but it's highly unlikely I'll ever revisit this.

Yet another 4x game that looks really polished and seems devoid of at least
some of the problems that many more half-assed attempts have.  Was on sale for
$15 on Steam.

Complaints:
- Has some graphical glitches and BSODs my computer occasionally.
- No space stations or a lot of the other features that are common in 4x
  games.  Definitely needs more stuff to do.
- The balance seems a bit off on system improvements vs. income in early game.
  The expansion disapproval is a bit rough as well then becomes a non-issue
  later on.
- Battles are just a non-interactive card game, but one with completely random
  results.  There's no reason to load these up once you've seen a few.
- Tech trees need more thought.  They're supposed to be divided by play style,
  but in reality they're somewhat mixed up.  Even worse, there's no way to tell
  (at least in game) what the tech unlocks do.
- Has the same useless diplomacy most 4x games have.
- The computer opponents cheat.
- At harder difficulties, you can easily get gimped from the start and have no
  real chance of winning.
- The UI is really nice except there are almost no keyboard shortcuts.
- Battles are too small and non-epic.  Fleets have a maximum command point
  size, which ensures battles will never have dozens of ships.

This is just an average 4x game, though it does have some really nice graphics
and universe creation options.  This is fine for a few days of fun, but won't
be replacing Stars! as my main 4x game.  I'll keep it installed for a few
months for an occasional game though.

Pure prolefeed, but so preposterous, I can't not at least play it for a couple
of hours.  I think it's going to be a F2P MMORPG.  Its gimmick is that it's
total, unadulterated fanservice.  Apart from that, it's completely generic.

Amusing for a couple hours, then just turns into a standard grind.  Like most
Asian MMORPGs, this lacks a lot of polish and has a sloppy feel to it.  After
this, I think I'm filled up on crappy games for this year.

A huge space strategy game that includes a lot of unique features.  Grabbed the
AI War: Alien Bundle on Steam, which includes the game and the first 3
expansions.  AI War: Ancient Shadows is still $4.99 (which is more than I paid
for the bundle), so I'll wait until I see how much I like the game first.

Some minor complaints:
- This being 2D kills the immersion some, since it's in space.  Being in 3D
  wouldn't work here, but gameplay could have been on planet surfaces.
- Animation gets choppy at higher time deceleration.
- At high resolution, it's hard to distinguish icons.
- Claims to have a lot of tower defense features, but doesn't really.
- The ship caps are workable, but I'd prefer if the bottleneck was more on the
  resource side than artificial unit count limits.

This is closer to a stock RTS experience than the game descriptions would lead
you to believe.  However, it's the best RTS I've played, and the only one I'd
consider playing long term.  It's a real timesink though, so I'll probably play

A possible candidate for a decent super-complex 4x game.

This game has some serious technical/performance issues.  To get playable FPS
on it, do this:
- Patch to 1.79.
- Edit data/HUDSettings.txt and define the windowed resolution to 1366x1024.
- Edit data/Settings.txt and set "Support Multithreading" to "TRUE".
- Set Video Mode to "1280x900x16".  Try windowed mode too and see if it gives
  30FPS (it probably won't).
- Set 3D Device to "Direct3D HAL".
- Set Video Memory Usage to "Safe".
- Turn off ClearType text in Windows.  There's a utility for this that can be
  found by typing in "clear" into the Windows search box.

I finished the tutorial and played this a little.  However, I'm going to cancel
this due to the many technical issues with getting this to run properly.  I can
get this to be barely playable, but everyone online says that even if you
manage this, the game will slow to a crawl once you have a lot of active units.
Given this, I can't justify wasting a week to learn everything to play this.  A
real shame, since this looks fairly close to what I'd want in a modern 4x game.

I think I pretty much know what I want my ultimate 4x experience to have.  It
needs:
- Solar systems with multiple planets.  Planet types should be realistically
  distributed according to distance from the star (e.g., no ice planets in
  close orbit).
- Space stations, preferably with the ability to place them anywhere in a
  system, not just in orbit of planets.
- Space and ground combat, with orbiting forces supporting ground forces.
- Moons with the ability to colonize them.
- Some simulation of the vastness of space.  Traveling vast distances should be
  an appropriately lengthy endeavor.  Planets shouldn't be so close together.
- Some appropriate system for upgrading obsolete components.
- Research that can't realistically be maxed out in any one game, even if it
  goes on for 1000s of turns.
- Weird races.  Since they don't have to be rendered, there's no excuse for
  making them all sentient versions of Earth animals.
- Nearly everything in the game should be able to be turned over to the AI.
- Non-interactive combat is fine, but battles should be potentially massive in
  scale.
- Faction personalities shouldn't be so 2 dimensional.  Diplomacy in all 4x
  games I've played so far sucks and I'd almost rather it not be there.

Got a free copy with both expansion packs from work, so might as well try it.

This is probably better than Civilization II, but has almost all the same
problems it does.  Almost every aspect of the game has design decisions that
annoy me.  It can still be entertaining if you were in the market for some
casual gameplay, I guess, but it's not for me.  I have a vision of what an
awesome engine for this type of game would look like, but I don't think
something like that exists.  I'll still give Alpha Centauri a try, but after
that I'm sticking with space 4x games.

Setup:
- Grab a copy of Magic Candle (it's free now) and extract it somewhere.

Trying this with a full semi-RP party.  Hopefully this isn't too much
micromanagement.  If this is too easy, replace the fighter with something
gimped, like a dual-wielding deep gnome ranger.

These steps get a completely working version on Win7:
- Install the 2.01 patch and put the bonus merchants pack in the Override
  folder.
- Be sure to set "3D Acceleration=1" in icewind.ini.
- There's a bug in the Fell Wood area that requires reverting to 800x600
  resolution while there.
- To fix the DirectDraw issues, install the Microsoft Application Compatibility
  Toolkit.  Run this and select "New Database" then click the "Fix" button.
  Point this at the IWD2.exe file.  Skip Compatibility Modes screen.  On

A good game, but I do have a couple complaints:
- A shame this is 3.0E instead of 2.0 or 2.5.  I'd even prefer 3.5 over this.
- I prefer the IWD1 UI over this one.
- Monk unarmed attacks need a better animation.
- Needs more skills ported over.  I should never have a character where I just
  don't care about skill points.
- Too many ambushes involving enemies appearing out of nowhere.
- Like IWD1, this game pegs a core while running.

Available for free, so worth a look.  I've always been fond of the concept
behind this game series (until they turned into action games, that is), but was
put off by the lacking design.  Now I'm considerably more forgiving about that
kind of stuff and much more into original concepts and complexity.  However,
I'm still not sure it's worth learning everything to play this, since it's very
prone to crashing.

Tried this and experienced constant crashes.  Will switch to Universal Combat

I never actually finished Morrowind, or even played much into the main quest.
I've been meaning to get back into the game at some point.  Only using the
Tribunal expansion (since werewolves don't really belong in this game, or
really any game).  Skipping some of the mods I used last time.

Setup notes:
- Install Tribunal patch.
- Use the instructions and launcher linked here for widescreen support and to
  increase draw distance: <span class="org-link">http://www.wsgf.org/dr/elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind</span>
- Use the `ra' command to reset NPCs when they start blocking doorways.

Playing a custom class that's almost exclusively magic-focused.  Unfortunately,
the game really isn't setup for hardcore perma-death play.

Collected a massive house full of stuff and finally beat the main quest and
expansion.  I'll save my saved game, but it's unlikely I'll ever come back to
it since the only things left to do are a few very minor quests with rewards
that are inconsequential to my uber character.  

Morrowind is on my list of best RPGs of all time, but I'll have to admit I
didn't quite enjoy the experience as much as before.  That's mainly due to:
- The leveling system is a bit broken.
- A magic-based build is severely gimped due to limited means of regenerating
  MP.  Even with a Breton and Mage starsign, the maximum MP you can have is
  still quite low.  There are some ways around this, but by that time, you'll
  start encountering high resist/reflect enemies.
- Builds in general don't have as much variety as the large number of skills
  would suggest.  Everyone needs some kind of physical attack and the same
  basic support magic.
- The game is riddled with bugs.
- Replayability is very low.  Most of what I did here was almost exactly the
  same as my last run.  In retrospect, I probably should have just restored my
  old save.

Available in a $5 bundle with two other games on Steam.  Consider using the NWP
(Naval Warfare Project) mod for it.  Runs on Win7 64-bit, but has some
graphical glitches.

Notes:
- To get higher graphics settings working with usable framerates, disable the
  radar display with C-v.
- The game has a bad habit of crashing occasionally, so save often.

Naval wargame fans always cite this as the ultimate operational sim.  I agree
that it probably is, since there really aren't many competitors (only Naval
Warfare: Arctic Circle, Global Conflict Blue, and the Harpoon games come to
mind).  While there are a lot of really nice touches here, the actual game
experience leaves a bit to be desired for me.  I'm not sure what's missing, but
I don't feel like a grand strategist playing this.  Maybe it's just at the
wrong level of abstraction for that kind of thing though.  One could possibly
enjoy this purely from a sim perspective, but for me it lacks the complexity
necessary for that and the interaction is too far removed from reality.  I'm
now thinking the optimal strategic naval sim would be platform-specific, but
with your platform participating in fleet actions, carrying out orders, or
engaging solo in limited actions.  Dangerous Waters is close to this, but is
missing the first part.

The second of the FO:NV DLCs.  The price was halved for these on Steam, so

In most ways, this is better than Dead Money, but I think I'd still rather be
playing ARMA 2.  I'm not sure if I'm just bored of Bethesda Fallout or if ARMA
has ruined my ability to enjoy more n00b-like FPS experiences.  With this
realization, I'll now be skipping the rest of the FO:NV expansions, which is
partly a shame, since supposedly the best DLC is Old World Blues.

As for the actual content, like the first expansion, it's not as polished as
stock FO:NV stuff.  The plot itself is pretty boring and has limited choices.
The new area is okay, but uninspired.  Overall, mostly a semi-yawn.

Supposedly one of the better mystery IF games ever.
<span class="org-link">http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=jdrbw1htq4ah8q57</span>

Not as good as normally claimed and has too many hidden actions that no normal
person would ever find.  It's also a time-sensitive IF game, which is extra
annoying.

Had DayZ SP working long ago, but wanted to try it out again with the new
stuff.  Supposedly this is possible and just requires a bit of file management.

<span class="org-link">http://kodabar.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/dayz-offline-single-player-practice.html</span>

Works great, but requires symlinking (mklink /j) the Addons folder from the non
OA ARMA 2 folder.  The SupportCall addon used in the conjunction with this
fixes some of the missing features (namely, editing the game time).  Despite
missing several important features from MP DayZ, this reasonably accurately
recreates the experience and is less annoying than playing online.  It still
gets old pretty quick though.

An RTS, notable for the number of units on screen.  Probably is a cross between
the Total War series and standard AoE-clones.

Eh, not as good as I thought it'd be.  Far closer to the other AoE-clones than
I'd hoped.  Might come back to this, but probably not.  I wish I had my $5

Looks decent and well researched, but I'm not sure I like this style of command

Watched some LPs on this and will skip it for now.  Doesn't offer enough over

Looks like a contender for a good modern 4x game.  Currently out, but has some
bugs and costs $30.  Will wait awhile for bug fixes and a price drop.

Looks like the developer abandoned this game with promised core features still
unimplemented and critical bugs unfixed.  Since he doesn't care, I don't
either.

Originally a project to create Stars! clone, this looks promising in that it
may capture some of the original's excellence.  This is still in active
development, so I'm not in any hurry to get started on it.

Setup a TP server, one or more AI clients, and the normal client on some
GNU/Linux box or VM.  See: <span class="org-link">http://www.thousandparsec.net/tp/downloads.php</span>

Looked into this some and spotted some deal-breakers, notably timed turns and
the lengthy turn completion.  This isn't terrible, and I'll consider this later
if I need some 4x action on Linux, but there are better games in this genre
otherwise.

Previewed a little.  This looks well made, but is more of a casual 4x game, so
I'll pass on it for now.  I need a lot more complexity than this to be

Looks pretty terrible, but is free and runs on Linux.

There's a lot of problems with this game that nullify its chances of ever being
good, most importantly its lack of a coherent vision and awkward skill/magic
system.  It is, however, marginally playable and if you were a Linux-only MMO
junkie, this would perhaps be good enough for a minor fix.

Maybe worth a play.  Looks a bit too casual-piloting focused for me though, but
the gameplay looks pretty good for that genre.  Check about running it in Win7
first.

Looked into it and I'm not in the market for arcade-style space combat, though

Now available, but is currently a complete bug-fest.  Also, from what I've seen
so far, I'm considerably less excited about this compared to any previous
X-series game, as it looks pretty dumbed down.  Overall, it's a mess.

Apart from bugs and price, at least some of these problems will have to be
resolved before I get it:
- The highway system is a lame mini-game.  As silly as SETA was, I'd rather
  have that as I could ignore it.
- Computer-controlled life in the game is a thin facade.
- The UI is extremely console-like and has awkward radial menus.
- First person exploration is nice and all, but if you're not going to do it
  right, don't bother.  It doesn't really add anything to the core experience.
- 1 ship only.  This doesn't bother me as much as other X fans, but it's a step
  backwards for this series.
- The map sucks.
- Only 1 active weapon at a time, no turrets, and only 5 total weapons removes
  an important strategy element.
- There's only a fraction of the depth of the X3 games.
- Using DX9 would be okay if it wasn't AAA priced.
- Interior textures are crap.
- Repetitive, unskippable animations and dialog.
- Many useful hotkeys I relied upon (like targeting) have been removed.
- It's not going to be possible to build up then manage a huge trading empire.

It's highly unlikely the core design decisions behind some of these
deal-breakers will be resolved, but I'd probably accept some compromise for
around $10.  I'll probably have to pass on this completely and just hope the
next effort (or one of the other Elite-clones in progress) addresses these
problems.

After reading the developer posts on the game post-release, it seems the design
is what they intended and intend to continue with, particularly with targeting
consoles.  So, barring some repentance on their part, it looks like I'll be
writing off Egosoft.

Latest ADOM with graphics.  Worth checking out to see how this looks, though I
can't imagine it improves anything.

I prefer the text version of this.  The graphics add nothing and actually
detract from the game in these ways:
- They're rather cartoonish, so the game loses some of the imaginative appeal
  to me.  I always visualized myself in a desperate struggle to survive.
- The perspective makes it harder to see things, including exactly which tile
  you're on.
- There's a few bugs when clicking on things, and the mouse panning makes the
  scrolling jerky if the pointer isn't centered.
- You can only see part of the map instead of all of it.

Otherwise the latest version supposedly has some improvements over the very old
version I was playing, so I'll upgrade to this for my installed text version.

Had this on Steam for years, but never got around to playing it much.  It's a
massive &gt;23GB install, so I'll try to finish with it quickly then clear off
that space.

Pretty good, but the thing I want is the open campaign that Rome: Total War
had, where you can start as any country and take over the game world.  The
flexibility to do what you want in the scripted campaigns is ruined by the time
limits.  A shame, because all things being equal, I'd rather play in this time
period.  this was the same result as last time, and I'm not sure why I bothered
again.

A classic Infocom IF game.

Some good points, but has a lot of the same annoying puzzles (the kind with
colored buttons/levers/slots that don't integrate into the world) that plague
many Infocom games.  Would require a lot of trial and error (probably many days
of it) to actually beat normally, and I'm not going to bother.

I've concluded I only really like modern story-IF, and even then, only when
it's extremely well written.  Won't bother with any more of old puzzle IF.

An Infocom IF game.  One of the first heavy story-driving IF games and
supposedly quite good.  The manual is needed to play this for the table of
decoder codes (the built-in copy protection).

Possibly one of the more ambitious IF games ever made.  The left/right
political dichotomy (and the author's thinly veiled leanings) could be done
without though.

Skipping, due to being an old puzzle IF.  If I ever do want to play one though,
I'll try this one.

After more investigation, it doesn't look like this would keep my interest very

This looks like a suitably complex RPG and is a good example of what's possible
with Allegro.

Notes:
- Site with info: <span class="org-link">http://www.popehat.com/helherron/</span>
- To sell stuff, enter trade and using the "," and "." keys to access character
  inventories.  Then highlight an item and use the "s" key.
- Search bodies, barrels, and other objects with "s".

Almost a good game.  If these things were fixed, it'd be playable:
- Searching for secret doors wouldn't be so bad if you didn't have to target a
  wall tile.  The Nethack method would've made this not suck.
- I like a challenge, but the difficulty of some encounters is completely
  impossible.  I min/maxed a full party, but ended up getting blocked at every
  point.  Farming up the necessary XP to level would take days.
- Some character builds don't have an appropriate sprite.
- Noob mobs like rats shouldn't inflict disease (totally gimping you) at 100%.
  This is very annoying when you don't have the cure disease spell yet.
- The title screen art makes me think this was written by a 12 year old.

This one goes in the "maybe play again if dreadfully bored" pile, but I
probably won't bother, since it's not compatible with modern OSes.  A shame,
because this kind of strategic, turn-based RPG is pretty unique and is a style
not available in any modern game (that I'm aware of).

Looks like it might be an interesting modern Stars!-style 4X game.  The Gold

Available for cheap on GOG, but I'm waiting for a sale.  Research this a little

Watched an LP.  Skipping this due problems noticed, including:
- Scale of star systems is all wrong.  The game has time compression, so
  there's no reason planets have to be right next to each other.
- Space is too bright.  Apparently the Earth is in the middle of a colorful
  nebula.
- Too fast-paced.
- More like Sins of Solar Empire than Stars!.
- The campaign is okay, but nothing great.

Probably would still play it if it was free, but this gaming experience isn't

The best turn-based squad tactics game I know about.  Grabbed for $5 on a Steam
sale.

Notes:
- The 1.13 mod changes this from an okay game into an awesome one:
  <span class="org-link">http://ja2v113.pbworks.com/w/page/4218339/FrontPage</span>
- The Arulco Revisited mod makes the game world considerably more interesting
  (requires 1.13).  This requires launching from the INI Editor (there's an
  inconvenient workaround for this, but this works fine for me).
- The game has many, many bugs, some of which can completely ruin a saved game
  or lock up a computer.  Backup in many save slots and don't run other
  programs.
- Ja2_sp.ini is convenient for remembering preferred starting options.
- The 1.13 setting ENABLE_EMERGENCY_BUTTON_NUMLOCK_TO_SKIP_STRATEGIC_EVENTS
  should be set to true to prevent cutscene hangups.  Now, holding NumLock will
  skip them if they get stuck.
- Turn off "merc lights" to fix the jerky scrolling at night.
- For the infinite loading clock bug, sometimes Alt-Tabbing out then holding
  Alt or using M-Enter clears it up.
- To craft items, pick one component up in tactical view, RMB on the other,
  then C-LMB the default slots.
- Use Tab to cycle targeting rooftops.
- To use under-slung GLs, click the burst icon twice.
- Use S-n to do a full team smart goggle swap based on conditions.
- M-LMB in the sector inventory can be used to auto-sell stuff to locals, but
  I've set the sell cost to 10% of item value to balance out the full item
  drops (which really helps immersion).
- Use of the End key in combat shows line of sight information.
- Use Insert in tactical mode for a mini-map.
- A good battle workflow is the hit S-b at the beginning of a battle to drop
  backpacks (these reduce AP).  Once over, use C-S-f to return them, unload
  dropped weapons, and sort sector inventory.  Then use C-S-m to merge items.
- Once piles of ammo are in my hoard location, use C-S-a to convert it all to
  crates.  Crates are also useful for transporting lots of ammo in a vehicle.

While 1.13 and AR make this one of the greatest games of all times, I still
have a few complaints:
- Bugs everywhere.  I looked at the C source for JA2:UB, and while not
  terrible, it's a bit of a mess and the amount of bugs isn't surprising.
- Most of the additional music provided by AR is pretty bad.
- A lot of the really excellent 1.13 features are very obscure and/or
  inconvenient to use.  This is probably just a result of JA2 not being
  designed with them in mind.  A context menu on objects would make things way
  easier.
- Windowed mode works okay, but lacks the edge scrolling and leaving the
  tactical map manually.
- Though extremely well researched, there's still a few factual inaccuracies
  regarding weapons/items.  Also, there's some non-realistic quantification of
  various real world things (e.g. 10mm is more powerful than .40 S&amp;W).
- Breaching rooms needs work.  Something like having a better ability to toss
  grenades through doors/windows would fix this.

I may play this again some day, perhaps once 1.13 has more features.  In that
event, I'll change the following:
- Tweak the settings some to allow for slower progression, as the increased
  enemy kills maxed this out a bit too early (see the "Game progress weights"
  section).
- Make my item stash at Estoni.  Then spares can be regularly carted to San
  Mona and Hamous can be stationed there to sell them every day.  I can also
  store unrepaired stuff in the junkyard, and only the repaired stuff and ammo
  in the airport, to spare myself a lot of manual sorting.
- I'll do a completely different collection of high WIS chars (except Flo,
  which I'll keep), only have max 2 IMP chars, and probably just run two main
  squads with perhaps one backup squad of free campaign characters.

they'll bundle them together some time.

Judging from what I've read online, my best guess is this is a light RPG with
turn based squad tactics and pretty shallow at both of these overall.  Given
that assessment, I'll wait awhile until the price drops, if I get it at all.
More content is also being released and sold separately, so maybe waiting for a
bundle is the better course of action, so as not to get DLC-milked.  There's
also a highly rated campaign called "Dead Man's Switch" to download.

Despite wanting a new Shadowrun RPG, I don't think this is it.  This has a few
redeeming qualities, but overall actually manages to have less depth than the
16-bit console games:
- Guns have infinite ammo.
- Matrix combat is exactly the same as normal combat, just with IC instead of
  humanoids.
- Tablet-centric UI.
- No proper save system.
- Extremely linear plot.

This won't make me a statistics expert, but I'll at least not be a total cl00b.

I've learned a lot of about statistics in the last 3 years.  While I still
think it'd be cool to understand it in more depth, I don't think the payoff is
there post-resigning from work.

    - State "CANCELED"   <span class="org-date">[2013-01-02 Wed 12:35]</span>
For a whole day, do absolutely nothing.  That includes no reading, walking
anywhere, writing anything, using a computer, doing chores, talking to anyone,
or anything else that could even be remotely considered an activity.
Obviously, I'll need to do a couple things to stay alive, so these activities
are exempt (if done in necessity):
- Eating.
- Going to the restroom.
- Showering in the morning.
- Having a glass of water nearby, refilling it, and drinking from it.
- Brushing teeth and other hygiene.
- Walking between rooms (only provided I need to do so for one of the above
  reasons).
- Turning on/off lights.

By this standard, almost no one has had a day where they did nothing.  Why not
find out what it's like?  This might also help if ever in prison.

I suspect I'll find this uncomfortable.  But, as primitive humans were content
to often do this all day, perhaps modern life has overstimulated me.  There's
only one way to find out for sure.

After some thought, decided to cancel this idea.  I'm sure I'll have the chance
to do this plenty when I get old.

Though starting this was actually a series of realizations and actions over
several years, I'm marking this started in January 2008, which is the month I
achieved $0 net worth.  I have a detailed org-mode plan for this elsewhere, but
it deserves an entry here too.  This is, after all, top priority for me, as
accomplishing the many things I really want to do in life are predicated on
making this happen.  Once I achieve FI and quit working, I'll cancel all
unfinished work-related tasks here and replace them with post-work items (of
which I already have a pending list for).

By my original plan, I am leaving work slightly early, but I consider what I've
achieved to be FI.  To hopefully close this gap and increase security even
more, however, I will be occasionally attempting to make money via non-job
methods.

This is tied to the financial independence task, but I also want to strategize
the specifics of my exit.

The plan:
- Tweak LaTeX resignation letter and turn it in.
- Leave on good terms with coworkers.  No point in taking any dumps on the
  desks of any sorry plebs.  The ones who've earned such treatment will get
  exactly what they deserve in the form of a life of employment, after all.
- Pass on all good-bye parties and such.  I've always done these when resigning
  in the past, but I think I'd rather just walk.  I'll also skip on sending out
  a clever goodbye email.  This one will just read "Bye".
- Don't bother expending any energy on the exit interview.  Just find out
  about:
  - W-2 mailing.
  - Clearances.
  - 401k.
- Take off 2 months to do the following:
  - Play video games all day.  I'll get sick of this pretty quick, probably in
    a few weeks at most.
  - Catch up on personal tasks.
  - Find a new apartment and move.
  - Sell unneeded crap.
  - Switch mental mode into complete independence.
  - Work on physical health.
  - Read a few books.

I'll quickly tire of being idle.  At that point it's time to get to the rest of
the tasks listed here, plus get started on my startup ideas.

Unfortunately, this is only good for 5 years and requires notification if
moving to a new county (adding yet another moving task).  Plus there are
annoying fees and navigating the necessary paperwork is a real timesink.  But,
the end result is worth the effort and now I'll always have my LCP or Detective

Observations for 2013:
- Quit work late April.
- Downscaled life to approximate planned transition period.
- Minimized many possessions.
- Deworkified brain.  This included mostly non-productive tasks.  However, I
  did managed to knock out the vast majority of tasks in the fiction and games
  section.  Apart from the much needed break, there was much to be gained from
  doing this, but I probably overdid it some.

Goals for 2014:
- Try to earn at least $30k.  If it doesn't look like I'll be able to do that
  on my own by beginning Q3, I'll get a short term contract job, as I had left
  work earlier than planned originally anyway.
- Now that I'm settled into non-work life, starting at the beginning of the
  year, I'll "work" at least a full 8 hours a day on learning my planned
  programming skills or writing code.  This work is defined as stuff on this
  list, not including non-fiction, fiction, and games sections.  As with having
  a job, I'll give myself 2 days off a week (probably Sunday and Monday) to
  just play games or recover.  I've learned that operating without any
  structure whatsoever probably isn't going to work for me.
- Come up with a post-transition period plan and begin implementing it.

Had been meaning to read this since about 1998.  I had already heard the
important points here from secondary sources, but this is still a good read,
minus all the religious references and uselessly outdated technical specifics.

I'm not sure I agree with all of the author's recommendations for project
management, however.  I would modify his `surgical team' approach only
slightly, but I think a case can be made on how that conflicts fundamentally
with some of the other standard waterfall model suggestions.  Even just
considering the good stuff though, I think salvation has to come from languages
(and in practice, excluding idiots from a team and paying talented people
enough to truly be interested), not finding some magical project management
structure or workflow.  I've had enough exposure to the later alternative
methodologies to know they are attacking the problem the wrong way.

A higher-level introduction to cloud computing and a survey of the current

Pretty boring, but if you didn't know anything about cloud computing and were a
bean-counter, it'd be a okay introduction.  Despite being rather high-level,
this has strangely-selected, super-simple code snippets (probably just to pad
out the book).  It's also very repetitive.

Only read a little over half of this, but I'm calling it done.  This is really
crappy book and obvious short term tech book fodder.  It might as well have
been called "Learn Teh Clouds in 24 Hours".

Starting with this one since it's quite recent and includes the latest
Leiningen setup.

<span class="org-link">http://www.unexpected-vortices.com/clojure/brief-beginners-guide/index.html</span> 

Notes:
- Instead of variables, Clojure uses reference types.  The four types of these
  are: Vars, Refs, Agents, and Atoms.
- Namespaces: A function `my-func' in file src/my-proj/core.clj has a fully
  qualified name of `my-proj.core/my-func'.  `my-proj.core' is the namespace.
  Local functions and ones in namespace clojure.core can be called with their
  short name.
- Clojure uses vectors instead of arrays.
- When looking for libraries, first check the standard library at
  <span class="org-link">http://clojure.github.com/clojure/index.html</span> then contrib at
  <span class="org-link">http://richhickey.github.com/clojure-contrib/</span> then finally at Clojars.
- To use stuff from the standard library, just add a `(:require
  [clojure.string])' in the ns macro.  No project.clj edit is necessary.
- For contrib, add something like `:dependencies [... [org.clojure/data.json
  "0.1.2"]]' to project.clj and `(:require [clojure.data.json :as cdj])' to the
  ns macro.
- Maven Central hosts all contrib and Java libraries.  Find the Maven path for
  these at: <span class="org-link">http://search.maven.org/</span>
- lein-marginalia can generate docs from a library, which is handy for actually
  using it without having to delve into the code for most situations.  To
  enable this everywhere by default, add it to ~/.lein/profiles.clj.  Then run
  `lein marg' and check the uberdoc.html file in docs/. See this for the latest
  version: <span class="org-link">https://github.com/fogus/lein-marginalia</span>

An okay intro.  Not very comprehensive or anything, but good enough to get
your bearings in the Clojure ecology.

I read some of this, but I disagree with the usefulness of reading this paper

These are things that Hadoop core developers should care about, but I certainly

This book is full of useful info and no fluff.  Gave this a close read, but
didn't take notes or try to write programs along with it, so I might read it
again some day to make sure the tips here stick.  Definitely keep a copy of
this handy whenever writing Java, which is something I try to do as little of
as possible.

Update 2012-05-23: I made it through about 3/4 of this 2 years ago.  I haven't
written a line of Java since then, but kept this task open under the assumption
that I'd have to at some point.  Given my successful avoidance so far and no
prospects of having to write it in remaining time I have planned to have a job,
I think I can safely forget about this book.  If the worst does somehow happen,
I'll just reread it from the beginning, since I've forgotten a lot of it now.

This white paper definitely has a designed by committee feel to it.  The good
parts mostly just confirmed I don't really have any major fundamental gaps in
CS knowledge (by their measure), at least for the stuff I care about.  However,
a lot of the stuff included here are things I would argue don't necessarily
belong (or at least aren't essential) in a CS course.  True CS knowledge isn't
as ephemeral as things like security, current social issues, and human-computer
interaction.  That stuff definitely belongs in an SE program, but it isn't
science.

Notes:
- println auto-inserts spaces between parameters.  To avoid this, use the str

- Use all-ns to get a list of loaded namespaces.

At `C-h i d m Elisp'.  Reading this since I'm often stuck in ielm at work when
on a non-SLIME box.  This can definitely be frustrating once one realizes how
many CL niceties are lost.  I don't want to become an elisp guru, but a bit
more competence would make life a lot better.  This book is more of a reference
manual though, whereas the other built-in elisp book is more a proper
introduction.  I'd read that instead first, but it's broken on the RHEL distro
work uses.

Notes:
- Replace all `(if (...) (progn ...))' (if statements without else clauses)
  with `(when (...) (...) (...))'.
- For readability reasons, use () when representing nothing or an empty list
  but nil when representing false.
- This is the place to go to look up documentation on various aspects of
  elisp.  The programming workflow includes:
  - Using eldoc-mode to get the lambda list for known functions.
  - C-h d &lt;function-name&gt; to get the function documentation.
  - C-h i d m elisp s &lt;search-term&gt; to get the full docs on that elisp subject,
    where search-term is a function name, or other unique string.
- Floating point arithmetic is non-exact, so use something like this for
  floating point comparison:
  (defvar fuzz-factor 1.0e-6)
  (defun approx-equal (x y)
    (or (and (= x 0) (= y 0))
        (&lt; (/ (abs (- x y))
              (max (abs x) (abs y)))
           fuzz-factor)))
- A repeat..until loop can be written like:
  (while (progn
           (forward-line 1)
           (not (looking-at "^$"))))
- Use symbol-function to get a function definition.

Since I'm no longer stuck working in a SCIF all day, I'll end this task now.  I
read most of this, and learned a lot, but Emacs Lisp isn't something I really
want to focus on getting awesome at.

Notes:
- Given input data, can describe relevant queries.
- Uses an ANN (approximate nearest neighbor) algorithm.  This algorithm isn't
  too difficult and I could probably implement it myself.

I could see this method being very useful for stock market data.  Attempting to
find correlations between indicators/values would otherwise be an expensive
process and could never happen in near real time.  If I ever start doing some

Excellent paper and a great reference for anti-TDD arguments (among other
things).  I would possibly reclassify the control complexity group as time
though, thus making the distinction between stateless control and stateful
time-dependence.  In this sense, time-base operations are just another form of
state.  I'm not quite sold on subscribing to an functional-relation programming
paradigm, however.  I think it's been proved by now that pure functional
programming's added accidental complexity is worth the trade-off.

I have a pretty intuitive feel these days for the kinds of problems that don't
work or don't work well on MapReduce, but this may help formalize it some.

I thought this was going to be a real white paper, but it's actually hype-heavy
Cloudera spam.  There's some things wrong with it (e.g. data transformations do
not necessarily mean data loss).  Even this title is a lie since these aren't
really "common" problems, they're specific examples.  Most are pretty simple
too or even big data problems.

Despite the stupid here, if companies were actually using Hadoop (and local
clouds in general) in these ways, then that would still be an improvement.
Maybe the private sector isn't as clueless as my environment, but I've only
ever seen clouds misapplied and projects fail because of it.

I've read various parts of this in the past, but I'd like to start over and do
the whole thing.

Notes:
- eql compares if parameters reference the same object.  equal compares if they
  evaluate to the same value.
- Dotted lists: Normal lists are "proper lists", meaning the list x is proper
  where it's nil or the cdr x is also a proper list.  A dotted list is where
  the cdr is just a value.
- Graham's suggested comment system is the same as mine, except I don't use ;;;
  for function comments, but rather rarely for demarcating sections within
  files.

Finished reading.  Despite PCL's popularity, I still think this book is the
better CL intro in most ways.  I've done some of the problems so far.  I also
lost a few chapters worth of my solutions that were in my warzone notebooks
that are now gone, so redoing them would be needed.

Update 2012-09-18: I'm calling this done for now since I've been using Clojure
at work.  I know all the fundamentals of Lisp variants.  The only thing I'm
really missing is a lot of practice, ecological knowledge, and some of the
advanced topics.  I'm currently trying to decide whether to switch to Clojure

Tried to program ahead of the examples some and took more detailed notes in
~/src/lisp/pcl.  While otherwise good, the lack of exercises makes it more like
watching someone else code than learning it by doing.  I intend to come back

Update 2012-09-18: As mentioned in the ACL update, I'm currently undecided
whether I want to perma-switch to Clojure or not.  Both CL and Clojure have
their pros/cons, so it's a tough choice.  If I switch back to CL, I left off
here at the CLOS chapters.

This is an old (1920s) hard copy book I had laying around.  Reading it on the
DC Metro, since I need a book to read and I didn't plan to do the exercises in
here anyway (they're okay, just suboptimal time investments).  So, I'll get
what I can out of it with as close read as one can manage while seated within a
sweaty armpit of humanity.

Gave up on this as it just jumps from one random theorem to another without
much overall structure.  This isn't a useless book, but I'm sure I can find a
better one on this subject.  However, I've found that number theory doesn't
really interest me as much as it used to, so I'll probably at most do a quick
modern overview of it and call it done.

Recommended by an NGA rep I met in Afghanistan.  He claims this is applicable
as a guidebook for interaction with groups and individuals in his work and side
businesses.

While most of these examples are no longer timely, there's some interesting
observations here.  The parallels between conquering 16th century France and
modern Afghanistan are hard to miss.  Though the reasoning is a bit sloppy,
it's certainly better than most modern texts in what's now considered political
"science".

Read most of this, and I think I get the gist of it enough.  I'm resisting

After reading a lot of useless garbage, decided to start reading backwards from
the latest issue instead and just quitting when stuff gets hopelessly
outdated.  Gave up after finding only more garbage.  My analysis is that there
really isn't much to learn here, unless you were really into security (which
I'm not).  Even then, a lot of the actual info here is just lifted from other
sources, and I'm not convinced most of the writers of this aren't semi-n00bs
themselves.  Like, if you aren't smart enough to convert all your linebreaks to
either the Unix or Windows version, then I probably don't have much to learn
from you.

Listening to the Librivox audiobook of this while in the car.  Like all

This is short enough to be worth the risk of a couple nights of reading.

What I can maybe take away from this book is illustrated by this example of
negotiating for rent.  I wouldn't haggle directly on price in the standard way.
Instead, I'd say something like, "Your employer wants to get this room
occupied.  I would maybe like to occupy it, as it seems acceptable to me.
Let's work together on making this deal happen in a way that's acceptable to
all parties."  This does two things: It separates the employee from his
employer and it makes it so you're both working together to make this happen.

This book has successfully convinced me that confrontational negotiating is
almost always unnecessary.  The only exception to this is when the other party
insists on thinking that such a method is the only way and employs it.  In most
of those situations, it's probably better to just walk away if explicitly
stating a cooperating alternative approach doesn't work.

Despite lacking the benefit of decades of memetics thought, it's hard to find
much wrong with the content here, and this is full of great observations.

I've been thinking about how one would go about attacking a memeplex (either in
an individual or in society), and this book's emigration suggestion for
tackling it at a societal level is a good point I hadn't considered.  Perhaps
in a world absent of travel restrictions, memeplexes would have a much harder
time taking root (though I might argue if a global parasitic memeplex arose, it
could be quite dangerous).

A analysis on irrational behavior that is fairly universal.  The problem of not
just not questioning certain decisions, but not even thinking they are
something that is to be questioned, is something I come across regularly when I
discover yet another false or suboptimal implicit axiom I've been operating
under.  Maybe this book will help some in finding any remaining ones, making it
easier to spot them, or at least provide useful models for thinking about them.

Notes:
- Relativity: Watch out for decoy comparison goods/services.  These exist only
  to frame the internal comparison being made by the buyer.
- Price anchors: Always be wary of these.  It's probably safer to just default
  to some near ridiculous value for any goods or services and use that as my
  anchor, thus negating any externally introduced ones.  Even question whether
  something should be paid for at all.  Perhaps the anchor should be zero or
  maybe I should get paid for it (driving is a good example of something people
  pay a lot of money for, but wouldn't accept a job doing).
- Remunerate people with small gifts instead of money.  Money remunerations
  open up market analysis of pay.  Offering nothing makes the transaction based
  on social norms.  Giving a gift in exchange could be a way to get services
  that ordinarily would only be done by paying.  Gift value also matters
  little, provided it's not mentioned.
- This claims the most effective counter-procrastination is to impose
  artificial deadlines (preferably with actual penalties).  I agree with this
  and use this method sometimes for really hard stuff, but I still think it's
  symptom-treating.
- Closing doors is often more a net benefit than keeping too many open.
  Probably good advice for me with my many technical interests.

Complaints:
- The fact that actors (even a majority of them) in a market are misinformed or
  unable to properly value goods does not mean that a free market is
  impossible, it just means that it will be suboptimal proportional to the
  stupidity of the individuals composing it.  Furthermore, a free market
  doesn't mean that you can count on the market as a signaling mechanism for
  optimizing your own utility.  A market is free simply when it's not distorted
  by regulation, laws, and taxes.  You'd hope an economist would know this.
- Too many personal narratives.  The worst of this are personal stories and
  opinions I really couldn't care less about.  Less awful but still annoying is
  the over-focus of experiments the author's been involved in.  I want to hear
  about the best illustrations of these ideas, not just ones that glorify one
  guy's career.
- Too much useless side info.  Stay on topic and stop wasting my time.
- Overall, I don't really appreciate the sloppy, casual writing here.

Overall this book is pretty good in some places, but not that useful (at least
for me) in others.  The latter situations are partly because many of these
things are already concepts I'm viscerally aware of and have been thinking
about for years.

This is an awesome story and possibly one of the best pieces of fiction I've

super-intelligence.

else.  I may also pick up a hardcopy of his book "Stories of Your Life and

Found this on a list of supposedly great hard scifi novels.  It's not terrible,
but bad enough for me to quit at chapter 8.

This has a problem that kills a lot of books for me.  The problem is with
unintelligent characters, especially main characters.  A book that focuses on
the details of someone dumb just isn't interesting unless it makes up for it
significantly in some other way.  The main problem with that is that stupidity
is universally accessible (I can just go outside or read Usenet if I want to
experience that).  The books I really like all have in common some insight into
intelligent thought.  Of course, this means that the author himself will have
to be someone intelligent too (reference my theory that it's impossible to
convincingly write a character smarter than you).  This means that most books
are effectively trash, but that's just accepting reality.  Starting now, I'll
be insta-quitting any fiction that has a dumb main character.

While I'm changing my reading tasking rules, I'm also adding the requirement
that I have a rationale for adding any task.  If I don't have an expectation
for what I intend to get out of it, then I'm probably wandering aimlessly.
This goal may not be met of course, but analyzing what went wrong in either my
expectations or its execution will allow optimization of future tasking.
Retroactively applying this to all un-started tasks.

At least Coalescent looks like it might be interesting.  I like BDO (artifact)
hard scifi, and since it's so rare, I'll give this a look.  My other attempts
at Baxter works have all been disappointments though, so the hand will be on
the eject button.
- Coalescent: Has the overused trope of interleaved plots from different time
  periods in alternating chapters.  Some of this is okay, but it's mostly
  dreadfully dull.  A shame, since the subject matter (eusociality) is actually
  interesting and deserves better than this.
- Exultant: Read 18% of this but it's garbage, so I'm quitting this series.
- Transcendent: Skipping.
- Resplendent: Skipping.

The generic titles of these books reflect the generic nothing that happens in
them.  Occasionally, Baxter books deal with interesting subjects, but apart
from main idea selection, his writings pretty much suck.

The most potentially interesting of unread Greg Egan novels.

A bit dull and uneventful.  Quite the letdown.  Half of the novel involves a
society too far in the future, and the other half involves one too primitive to
be interesting.  This probably could have worked had it been a mystery novel
regarding the enigmatic galactic core civilization.

Read 25% of this, but it seemed to be going nowhere and was in a thoroughly
non-compelling universe.  Maybe it gets awesome later, but there's no
indication of that, so I'm giving up.

I'd actually started this some unknown time last year.  It's been rather
uninteresting so far though.  Will give this a focused final effort.  I may
cancel future efforts on MacLeod books though, due to his annoying politics (if
I cared about politics, I'd read books about that, not hard scifi).

Quitting due to the politics.  This seems like it may have been okay, but I
can't seem to muster the motivation to wade through the leftist crap.  

New reading rule: Insta-quit anything written by someone with an obvious left
or right-wing political bias and who can't keep their boring party-line
politics out of a story.

This is okay, but not really my thing.  It's less of a scifi novel, and more of

I like the IWD lore in the games (mostly), so maybe give these a try.
Supposedly these are good for books in the ADnD genre, but I'm not sure I can
trust fanboi opinions.
- The Crystal Shard: Has some okay qualities but is mostly silly and juvenile
  with a predictable plot and stereotypical, 1-dimensional characters.  Decided
  to finish this, but not read the other two.  The other books in this series
  don't actually take place in IWD either.
- Streams of Silver: Skipping.
- The Halfling's Gem: Skipping.

I think I'm maybe outgrowing this mythos.  There's much good stuff in it, but
it's tainted by a lot of crap too (e.g. original content is mucked up by an
affliction of Fantasy Kitchen Sink).  The editions are also moving in the wrong
direction, towards a generic FF-style level grind.  I guess I got into it
because of the BG and IWD series, but since no games like those have been made
since then, I probably have as much reason to follow it as before them.  There
are more creative fictional universes.  However, I don't seem to enjoy
immersion in any like I once did (like 10 years ago), mostly due to being able
to find so many glaring faults.  In any case, I'll probably ignore ADnD from
now on except for a final IWD and BG series playthrough at some point.

Got a Samsung Intercept with Android 2.1.  While I have no intention of doing
any real development for the platform at the moment, I'll at least check it out
to see if it's something I might want to do for some spare cash later.  Only
setting this up on Windows at the moment.

Remaining subtasks:
- Root phone.  Supposedly this is a tutorial:
  <span class="org-link">http://www.sdx-developers.com/sdx/how-to-root-a-samsung-moment-with-2-1-firmware/</span> 
- Delete lame apps from apps list.

Notes:
- Grab latest SDK from <span class="org-link">http://developer.android.com/sdk</span>.  Unpack and run
  installer.  Force download through HTTP if necessary.
- bsdroid is an Android SDK port for FreeBSD, but it's not yet complete.  Might
  install this just to do development on FreeBSD, since most everything is
  working for that, but installs will have to be done from Linux or Windows.

Update: Canceling this due to not having a smart phone anymore.  For now, I'm
going to use my work Blackberry, and when I have to give that back, I'll use a
pre-paid dumb phone.  The only way I'll reverse this decision is if one of
these things happens:
- I get into mobile development (which I'm really not interested in).
- Pre-paid smart phones become available for competing prices to the dumb ones.
- I find myself with more than enough money to fund the ownership of one.  This
  can easily cost $50k in today dollars over the course of the rest of my life,
  and I'm not currently willing to work that much more just for a phone with
  crappy apps I never use.

ZSH is my second most used user application after Emacs, so it makes sense to
dedicate massive amounts of time into tweaking it to perfection.

Cloned the project to ~/src/shell/oh-my-zsh.

Update 2012-05-03: Instead of using oh-my-zsh directly, I've decided to just
pull out of it the things I wanted.  The reasons for this are:
- New shells start about as fast as before this way.  With the full collection,
  there's a noticeable startup lag on my underpowered FreeBSD machine.  Apart
  from saving time, I'm also not source-ing a ton of scripts and burning clock
  cycles for nothing.
- The collection has many, many things I don't want.  There's a provided
  directory to override things with your custom settings, but instead of
  setting things to things you don't want, then putting them back, it makes
  more sense not to do what you don't want in the first place.
- I don't want to fork my own version of this repo.  The only way the
  collection was acceptable to me was to go in and modifying things in various
  scripts.
- I don't want to have new installs depend on anything outside of .zshrc.  Now
  I get the functionality wanted but without the cost of all those external
  dependencies.

So, .zshrc has been updated with git and SVN status support and a much better
prompt theme.  These were really the only things I wanted.  Created a follow-up
task for the next step in ZSH tweaking.

Despite Leiningen's popularity, the script itself is pretty sloppy, at least
right now.  I don't have time for a full learning of it yet, but I want to lazy
load that anyway, in case I end up not using it much.  From first glance
though, it seems to get the job done pretty good and has a nice CLI syntax.

Steps:
- wget <span class="org-link">https://raw.github.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein</span>
- Put this in ~/bin and chmod u+x it.
- On FreeBSD, change the bash hashbang path.
- Run `lein', which does some setup on the first run.
- Systems without `shasum' will report a download error due to a failed
  checksum validation when grabbing the Clojure jar.  Just verify that
  ~/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.2.1/clojure-1.2.1.jar and
  ~/.lein/self-installs/leiningen-1.7.1-standalone.jar are there.
- Make a test project somewhere to make sure everything works by running `lein
  new test-prog'.

If I start using this, follow this up by reading Leiningen's README.md and
TUTORIAL.md here: <span class="org-link">https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen</span>

This setup gives me 1.7.1, but it seems 2.x is much nicer, so I'll just use
that instead.  The above is therefore deprecated.

2.x Steps:
- cd ~/bin; wget --no-check-certificate
  <span class="org-link">https://raw.github.com/technomancy/leiningen/preview/bin/lein</span>
- chmod u+x lein
- Edit lein and change hashbang path.
- lein self-install
- Run `lein new test-proj' somewhere.
- Change project.clj to use the Clojure version of 1.4.0 and set `:main' to
  `test-proj.core'.
- cd to that directory and run `lein repl' to make sure everything works.  Run
  `(-main)' or `(doc -main)'.

With 2.x and Clojure 1.4.0, compilation and REPL startup is so slow that often
it times out on my crappy hardware.

Major mode to understand Clojure.  Needs swank-clojure to integrate with
subprocesses.  Managed to get this working without installing ELPA and without
messing up my SBCL settings; SLIME can be activated with either Clojure or
SBCL now.

Notes:
- Add clojure directory to $PATH.
- On Windows, create a clojure.bat file in the clojure directory, containing
  `java -cp C:\path\to\clojure.jar clojure.main'.  Run this to ensure a working
  REPL comes up.
- Add clojure-mode, clojure-contrib, and swank-clojure to ~/.emacs.d.
- Had to use an older version of swank-clojure.  Latest wouldn't work for me.
- Can send a startup parameter to SLIME with M-- M-x slime clojure.

Has many of the same commands for normal SLIME, and some extras, like:
- M-TAB: Auto-complete symbol at point.  Super useful.
- C-x C-e: Eval the form under the point.
- C-c C-k: Compile the current buffer.
- M-.: Jump to the definition of a var.
- C-c S-i: Inspect a value.
- C-c C-m: Macro-expand the call under the point.
- C-c C-d C-d: Look up documentation for a var.
- C-c C-z: Switch from a Clojure buffer to the REPL buffer.
- C-c M-p: Switch the REPL namespace to match the current buffer.

Update 2012-05-04: Since everything here has changed so much since I started
this, I'm going to redo it all from scratch.  Technically, this does complete
the effort with clojure-mode.  It's just swank-clojure that's messed up.

Switching to this instead of command line GPG, as it provides automatic
encryption of .gpg files.  This is now included in Emacs 23.

GnuPG 2.x has annoyed me for the last time with having to work around its
stupid UIs.  After trying to defadvice the EasyPG start function a few ways,
I'm giving up and downgrading to GnuPG 1.x, which is still available in
security/gnupg1.  Installing this without NLS support.

Notes:
- To encrypt a file, use M-x epa-encrypt-file and enter a passphrase.  GnuPG
  1.x allows this to prompt properly for one in the minibuffer.
- To decrypt, just open the .gpg file and enter the passphrase.
- If I ever need access to the encrypted data outside of Emacs, `gpg -o outfile
  somefile.gpg' still works.

With so much less typing to encrypt all personal data, there's no excuse to not
encrypt everything I wouldn't want to be public knowledge.

- Go to Help|Install New Software and add an update site for "Leiningen plugin

Using a few random websites and this document:
<span class="org-link">https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/preview/doc/TUTORIAL.md</span>

Notes:
- Use `(require 'test-proj.core :reload)' to reload a changed file.
- `lein run' executes a project from the CLI with the `-main' function location
  specified in projects.clj.
- Libraries don't need `-main' functions.
- `lein jar' packages up a project and `lein uberjar' creates a standalone jar.
  Note that this requires `:gen-class' specified to create the .class file
  ahead of compiling the jar.  With the uberjar, this can then be run as `java
  -jar proj-name-standalone.jar'.
- `lein search &lt;pkg-name&gt;' searches the Clojars and Maven Central repos.  This
  is useful for copying this info directly to the :dependencies vector in
  project.clj.
- `lein install' installs the current project to the .m2 repo.
- Reference this sample project.clj file for viewing all available options:
  <span class="org-link">https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/sample.project.clj</span>
- `lein deps :tree' prints the project dependency tree.

I think I know enough Leiningen to be productive.  There's more, but I need to
get stuff done and stop yak shaving.

I'm also switching to not installing Clojure from ports and will just use

Try this out for awhile.  I tried this before very briefly, but decided to stop

for awhile to see if these things gets annoying.  Currently, some of it seems
counter-intuitive.  Even if that feeling remains though, maybe it's worth it
for the mismatch detection (however, in that case, I should just extract that
code myself).

Update: Removed this as it gets in the way more than it saves me from
mismatched parens.  However, I'm leaving it in ~/.emacs.d, for the rare case
where I have a pair mismatched that I can't find.

I haven't activated ECB in years, so I might as well remove it and spare myself
the dependency management and startup time cost.

Removed ECB and CEDET blocks in ~/.emacs.  Removed now-unnecessary stuff from
custom-set-variables sexp.  Archived both of these to unused_init.el.
Uninstalled ECB port on FreeBSD.  Things like JDEE and nXhtml still require
EIEIO, which requires CEDET, so I can't remove that port until I upgrade to at
least 23.2 (it's included then).

Emacs starts up noticeably faster now.  Then it was just nXhtml that was slow
(but I actually use that occasionally).  Decided to look up how to byte-compile
nXhtml, which cut its start time down to nearly nothing.  To do so: Activate
menu-bar-mode, go to nXhtml|nXhtml Help and Setup|Byte Compile nXhtml.  Now
just CEDET and EIEIO are slow, but on modern hardware it's quite fast overall.

Consider replacing elscreen with this.  Supposedly better integrated.  Worth a
try, since elscreen has a few issues (namely: the window lists getting cut off
by vertical windows, window lists duplicated on C-x 2, and dependency upon
apel).

<span class="org-link">http://www.splode.com/~friedman/software/emacs-lisp/src/escreen.el</span>

Grabbed and rebound the prefix key with:
(setq escreen-prefix-char "\C-z")
(global-set-key escreen-prefix-char 'escreen-prefix)

Well, this works.  The main difference though is that escreen doesn't have a
nice way to tell what's where.  The different screens are just numbered, and I
think that at least for me, the elscreen tabs do prevent me from scrolling
around more than necessary.  I can see myself using escreen and living without
that, but since the main elscreen feature is actually useful for me, why should
I?  It's a close one, but I'll stick with elscreen for now.  I may change my
mind later though.  I do like the idea of getting that extra line of text back.

This failed last time, but with as much JDEE-related suffering as I've been
enduring, and seeing as how there's no end to it in sight, I'd say it's worth
another try.  Don't bother putting a lot of effort into it though, since I
intend to write much less to no Java in the future.  I would like to keep some
at least minimal Java functionality in Emacs, since even if I'm not a Java

occasion.

Update 2012-05-25: I was going to get started on this, only to discover
malabar-mode is now unmaintained.  Since it's been 7 months now with no one
stepping forward to keep it going, I'm making a task to look into emacs-eclim

Installed helm and helm-ipython and they both seem to work fine.  The use
workflow is:
- Open Python source file.
- Use C-c ! to load an iPython shell.
- Use C-c M to load the source file imports into the iPython environment.
- Type something to complete (e.g. `sys.') and hit M-TAB.

My Python setup is pretty decent, but it could be better.  In particular, I'm
missing a decent completion mode (consider anything-ipython for this).

Note that anything.el may have been renamed to emacs-helm.

I'm basically starting from the base major mode and revisiting all decisions
made, then comparing the end results.  It's hard to tell what's current out
there, and this is mostly Emacswiki's fault, but also the tools are a bit of a
ghetto as well.

Notes:
- Attempted to upgrade python-mode from 5.2.0 to 6.0.8.  This seems to now
  include a lot of extra stuff.  The mode's page is pretty terrible and hard to
  find information on.  I think the README file was written by someone
  illiterate too.  In any case, it broke compatibility with iPython, so I'm
  sticking with the old version.
- Edited ~/.ipython/ipy_user_conf.py and uncommented the import for
  ipy_greedycompleter.  This enables completion in the iPython shell.
- Created a separate task for emacs-helm, so I can document its setup.  This
  was successfully added and seems pretty nice.
- Apparently pyflakes wasn't installed.  Downloaded this from
  <span class="org-link">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyflakes</span> and ran `setup.py install --user' (after
  modifying the hashbang since they were too dumb to use env).  Added
  ~/.local/bin to $PATH in ~/.zshrc.  Activating flymake-mode for all Python
  files by default.
- Noticed that python-describe-symbol is only in python.el, not python-mode.
  It's a shame to lose this, but I never seemed to use it obviously, or I'd
  have noticed it by now.  I'd rather trade that for the iPython integration.

I think that does it.  I now have flymake, source completion, and interpreter
completion.

If I ever really want to take it to the next level, I could add pylookup for
documentation browsing/searching and integrated debugging support.  This guy's
blog post shows this:

just run the server on the same machine, though I haven't decided where I want
it yet (reduced latency on cellblock vs. reduced local CPU/HD usage on muze).

Tasks:
- Check open ports with `sudo nmap -sS -F 127.0.0.1'.
- Setup pf and create exclusive rule for port 3306.
- Once closed, ensure that `telnet macroexpand.com 3306' doesn't work from
  outside.
- While I'm at it, check `SHOW GRANTS;' and use the REVOKE command to clean up.

Once I have pf (or some other firewall) setup, I can then easily block some of
the SSH brute force spamming and HTTP exploit attempts.  Added a pf/altq task
for this.

Update 2012-07-02: I'm just disabling MySQL on macroexpand.com.  However, if I
ever do get around to using it for something, I can just add
`bind-address=127.0.0.1' to /etc/my.cnf.

Since I'll be using Clojure for work, I need to get this running as smoothly as
my SBCL SLIME setup.  

Some info is here (but it seems some of it is outdated):
<span class="org-link">http://dev.clojure.org/display/doc/Getting+Started+with+Emacs</span>
Deferring to this instead:
<span class="org-link">https://github.com/technomancy/swank-clojure/blob/master/README.md</span>

Setup:
- Deleted old clojure-mode, clojure-contrib, and swank-clojure setups.
- Use an existing project or create a test one and open the projects.clj file
  and add `[lein-swank "1.4.4]' to the :plugins section.
- Run `lein repl' on the project to pull in the lein swank dependency.
- Open project.clj and run M-x clojure-jack-in.  A SLIME REPL should eventually
  come up and eval-ing the source buffer should allow one to call a function
  like (test-proj.core/test-fn).
- To switch to the project's namespace, compile it first with C-c C-k, then use
  C-c M-p.
- Alternatively, if you add a lein-swank dev-dependency, you can run `lein
  swank' from the CLI and then M-x slime-connect to that REPL.
- For long running or complex applications, it might be a good idea embed a
  swank server in the application.

Notes:
- Clojure REPLs take like a minute to start.  SLIME with SBCL started up in a
  few seconds.
- Once again, I have no way of using both SBCL and Clojure.  This is an
  unacceptable outcome and I'll have to resolve it some way or another.
- SBCL SLIME setup is commented out for the moment.

Update:
swank-clojure is now deprecated.  Look into nrepl.el instead.  Created new task
for this.

I'm not sold on this idea, since this abstraction doesn't add anything, nor
does it provide anything the base language does not.  SCSS is probably a better
option.  Haml seems like an abstraction for the sake of abstraction.

mainly just interested in whether this is something I'd be interested in first.
If not, I'm a lot less interested in ham radio in general and can de-prioritize
a whole set of potential upcoming tasks accordingly.

Packet radio is pretty interesting.  However, there are some problems for what
I'd want to use it for:
- Most of the time, it's used to set up distributed local networks.
- I won't be able to get above 9600baud without special equipment.  Apparently
  normal speeds are often slower.
- This concept was far more popular back in the 80s.  Hardly anyone uses it
  now, so there usually won't be a network around.
- What I wanted to use it for (to access gateways to the real internet) isn't
  possible.  These gateways don't exist (or at least aren't common).

Probably will still try ham radio out sometime, just for fun.  However, I'm
lowering its priority based on info found here and I'd be fine with skipping it

It looks like I will have to write some Scala after all, thanks to my
scatterbrained work environment.  I'm going to do it (more) properly this time
though, starting from scratch:
- Install sbt.  Ensure it can pull in specified versions of base Scala.
- Activate scala-mode from the latest Scala distribution, if it's still there.
- Install ENSIME.
- Get the ENSIME REPL up.

sbt (manual install):
- Grab latest sbt from
  <span class="org-link">http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html</span>
- Put somewhere and update my ~/bin/sbt script to point to the new
  sbt-launch.jar.
- Create a test project with a directory containing a source file and a
  project.sbt file.  Run it with `sbt run'.

scala-mode: This seems to not be distributed anywhere, but I found a copy in
some SVN repo.
- git clone <span class="org-link">https://github.com/scala/scala-dist.git</span>
- Grab the scala-dist/tool-support/src/emacs and move it to
  ~/.emacs.d/scala-mode.

ENSIME:
- Grab a recent distribution from:
  <span class="org-link">https://github.com/aemoncannon/ensime/downloads</span>
- Extract and move to ~/.emacs.d/ensime.  For BSD, change the hashbang in
  ensime/bin/server.
- Activate the sbt ensime plugin (which allows the `ensime generate' command to
  create a .ensime file in an existing project from the sbt shell) by following
  the instructions on: <span class="org-link">https://github.com/aemoncannon/ensime-sbt-cmd</span> Use
  "latest.milestone" for the version.
- Create the .ensime file in the above test project, open the .scala file in
  Emacs and execute M-x ensime.

Scala (manual install): This is for running REPLs.
- Grab the 2.9.2 tarball.  Edit the hashbang in all scripts in bin/.
- Check updates to $PATH, $CLASSPATH, and $SCALA_HOME in ~/.zshrc.

Rolled back my original Blekko changes and added them in the new manner, but
there's some issues.  The main one is that Blekko no longer accepts these
perfectly well-formed searches anymore, so I'm stuck with gg: until that
changes.  Also, only the default search URIs are active at load, until you at
least do one successful search.  As a result, I just added searches for Hoogle

Tableau is an application that allows advanced visualization of datasets from
various sources (databases, cubes, spreadsheets, etc.).

Being an end-user application, I want to know as little of this as possible.
Just skimming the manual and using it for a day should be enough to gain
minimal familiarity.  A lot of functionality is very well hidden here though,
so it'll take awhile to find it all.  Calling this done since I know enough to
be work-productive in it, which is all I really needed.

Note: 7.0 (the next version) will include the ability to append new information
to existing Tableau datasets -- a useful feature for work application of it.

Cascalog promises to be a higher abstraction level means of managing all things
Hadoop-related.  This includes workflow management that would normally require
something like Cascading (which Cascalog also builds upon).

If this lives up to its promises, it could be pretty awesome.  It's hard to
tell without actually trying to use it first though.   The potential is worth
looking into, as the alternative will be a mess of a cloud stack with analytic
workflow components in at least half a dozen languages.

<span class="org-link">https://github.com/nathanmarz/cascalog</span>

The plan:
- Watch the LinkedIn Cascalog presentation video for a quick overview.
- Get at least competent with Clojure.
- Run through the included examples.
- Set up some tests using HDFS.
- Determine whether this can be scaled up to suit project needs.
- If so, write a minimal demonstration and/or one that includes something with
  an outer join and post-join filter (these are horribly inefficient in Hive).

Cascalog's REPL is too slow on my home workstation (it's so bad, the servers
time out before they can connect), so I need to do this on VMs on my worktop or
beefbox.  Setup is now complete.

Update: The timeouts are fixable by setting :repl-options {:timeout 60000}.  I
now have working Cascalog analytics as well, and these are pretty nice.  The
environment setup is a total pain, but part of that was getting used to
Clojure, though it was mostly the result of inadequate documentation.

Based on my success criteria for this task, I consider it done.  There's still
a lot of more advanced features I'm not particularly familiar with here, but
hopefully that will come in time.  If I'm having problems later, I'll create a
plan for more comprehensive learning (and that might not be a bad idea in
general, if this ends up being a integral part of the dev stack like I hope).

Surprisingly good.  A well-developed mythos and a solid hard scifi effort.
However, I do have a few complaints:
- The world is too non-interactive.
- Some minor consolitis, mostly in the UI and game world.
- The Frogger-style mini-game isn't any fun to play 1000s of times.  Having to
  play it to examine artifacts and such doesn't even make sense.
- Has fanservice.
- A more realistic way for weapon damage to work would be only being able to
  take a few shots at most once shields were down.  As it is now, shields can
  go down and characters can take dozens of relativistic speed slugs.

Since I finished all of the in-game content, and generally enjoyed most of it,
I thought I'd try the first of the FO:NV expansion packs.

This was about average for Fallout content and not quite worth $10.

Complaints:
- Being cut off from the rest of the game world kinda sucks, but I guess it's
  necessary for the story as it is.  I'd rather FO:NV's main overland area be
  expanded instead, since it's too small.
- Hardcore mode's HP depletion over time was just annoying instead of
  challenging.  I'd rather the cloud stuff be removed altogether and just have
  the difficulty raised in some less arbitrary way.
- The plot misses the mark a little on immersion.  It's close, but not quite
  good enough to really get into.
- The new enemies have no variety at all.  In fact, there's really only one
  enemy you fight the whole time, over and over.
- Content is completely linear.

Also added the Louder Guns mod (the pleasantly quiet gunshots always annoyed
me).  Unfortunately, it doesn't work with new DLC guns that have different
sound effects: <span class="org-link">http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/35098</span>

FO:NV is the last Bethesda or Bioware game I'll ever buy right off the presses.
The DLC milking is definitely out of control when they can cost more than the
original game (often a lot more).  If I had just waited 2 years, I could have
bought it all combined for a fair price.  I'd be okay with it if DLC content
was superior to original game, but it tends to be significantly inferior.

Includes the original and the expansion pack.  Pretty mindless, but I had work
order a copy for me to play occasionally while in Afghanistan, since I figured
it would run on my work laptop.

After playing this quite a bit, it got painfully boring.  I played the original
back in 2004 and quit after a few days.  Now I remember why.

Complaints:
- My main complaint is the drop system that randomizes loot in the Diablo
  model.  This works in Diablo and Rogue-likes, but not here, probably due to
  the lack of attention given to making it interesting.  Since farming up items
  is the main activity in this game, it has to get this right.
- Due to the drop system, there's no real motivation to explore far off the
  main quest path or solve side quests.  If you need more lever pulls to
  upgrade gear, you might as well just kill the most accessible named trash
  mobs.
- Side quest areas are all generic and boring.
- Serious performance issues are present, making the game nearly unplayable on
  my laptop.  It almost runs fine on my desktop, but I have to keep it in
  windowed mode since alt-tab doesn't work.
- Shops are useless except to unload loot, though there's really no reason even
  to collect stuff to sell since you don't need money for anything.
- Has the annoying leveled XP system that most modern MMORPGs have where XP is
  scaled based upon the difference between the player character and the mob.
- Boring, too non-interactive of a world.  Staring at dead backgrounds looking
  for secret hiding places isn't fun either.

I'd have a hard time listing what this game does well.  I guess the pixel art
is decent enough.  This is just a really poorly executed knock-off of D2.
There's no good reason to play this instead of the real thing.

Better graphics and more polish.  Has another good (though inferior) storyline,
but so many of the RPG elements have been removed or simplified that it's hard
for me to even consider it an RPG, except in the most superficial way.

Complaints:
- Not as open of a game world as ME1.
- Even more fanservice.
- Even more consolitis.
- n00bification of several game elements like inventory management,
  weapons/armor, and character skills.
- Combat encounters are too structured in a way that results in less overall
  variety.  You can always tell one is coming up when you see a certain
  environment layout and each one plays out very much the same.
- Mission areas are nearly completely linear.
- Mini-games are better, but still not fun.  Would rather such things just be
  based on leveled skills and have the game itself be more interesting.
- Crouching was removed.  Character movement in general feels sluggish (FO:NV
  is so much nicer).
- No map in most places, though I guess you don't need one with such linearity.
- Includes QTE (and even considers it a feature).
- Your character meets up with just about everyone he ever left alive in ME1
  despite the size and population of the universe.

While I had plenty of complaints about ME1, I still liked the game.  I'm pretty
sure I actively dislike ME2 though.  I really want to like it for its good
points, but the actual game playing experience is overall an unpleasant one.

Won't be playing ME3, since it's more of the same.  Skimmed through an LP of it
just to get the story instead.  The story has some well known problems and some
really deep flaws/inconsistencies, but is still pretty good in my opinion.
However, unlike most complaints, my biggest gripe with the ending was that the
revelation isn't one that forces the player to rethink something big and is a
missed opportunity.  Lastly, I'd comment that this kind of result is inevitable
when you write a huge story as you go.  At least some upfront outlining is
essential to make sure everything fits.  This is why most JRPGs and televised
series are just a random walk through whatever.

The latest AA game.  I had a lot of fun playing AA:O years ago, and wanted to
check out the new version.

This new version is pretty much a failure and most of the bad press it got was
well deserved.  The game mechanics are all clunky and it's missing all of the
cool stuff from the old game (like handguns and jump-tossing grenades).
Basically, I have no desire to play this game.  Apparently AA 2.5 still exists,
so I'm switching to that and forgetting about 3.

The old version of the AA game.  3 was kind of a let down, so I'll give the old
client a try again.

Setup:
- Download AA 2.5 Assist program from <span class="org-link">http://aao25.com/</span> and stick it somewhere.
- Run the installer.
- Setup an account on <span class="org-link">http://battletracker.com/</span>
- Set the AA 2 name in the Tracker Settings in My Profile.

This is pretty much the state of the game the last time I played it.  I wish
more people were playing it though, so I could just hang out on Bridge Crossing
defense for hours.  This isn't the fault of the game or anything, but the
average skill level is very advanced, so there's no hordes of n00bs to kill.
Played this for awhile, but I think my tastes in milsims has changed such that
only something at least as realistic as ARMA works for me.

An ARMA 2 semi-persistent world zombie mod.

Setup:
- Install ARMA 2: Combined Operations.  I bought it on Steam.
- Get Six Updater: <span class="org-link">http://www.six-updater.net/p/download.html</span>
- Install Six Updater and run Six Launcher.  Find DayZ themed program in the
  server browser and click the Update button.
- Start up both ARMA 2 and ARMA 2: OA from Steam to get all updates.
- Start up ARMA 2: OA and create a new profile (make sure it's selected) and
  change settings.
- Turn off all anti-aliasing.  On my Radeon, this causes all the graphics to be
  messed up.
- Set video memory to default.
- To prevent random temporary freezing, close Six Updater after launching.

DayZ SP:
- Note that 1.7.2.4 will break the SP mod.  I've backed up a copy of 1.7.3 for
  this reason and a working SP .pbo.  Launch with the beta enabled and enable
  @DayZ in the expansions menu and restart.  Cheat scripts seem to be
  non-functional and restoring saves only partially works, so each game has to
  be a single play through.

A great concept, but a horribly buggy and has some flaws.  This game was fun
for awhile, but the perpetual death match aspect of the game is really all
there is to it, and that gets old eventually.  It's quite easy to get awesome
gear and just go live in the woods, but that's even more boring.  I'll come
back to the game later if updates fix some of the problems with it.

Single player is pretty much no challenge and lacks the main allure of the game
(the unpredictable nature of other players), but is okay for some item
collecting and trying out stuff.  Another option are private hives like
DreamHive (see <span class="org-link">http://www.dayzhive.com</span>) for connection info.

Various promising looking mods.
- Chernarus Apocalypse: A COOP mod for ARMA 2.  This is supposed to be for 6-10
  players, but I wanted to try it solo.  However, it's pretty close to
  impossible, but it can be a little fun to see how far you can get.
- Dawn of the Apocalypse: The single player prologue to the above.  Not bad,
  but too short and the spawn is too dense
- Ghosts of Chernarus: Not a big fan of racing against the clock in this game.
  I want my missions to take hours, if possible.

None of these were really all that playable.  I'll maybe try more mods later,
but I'll finish the included content first.  I've mainly just been making my
own missions so I can play the way want to, however this does take away any
surprise factor as by the time it's complete, I've already tested it several
times along the way.

Update: After heavily editing Chernarus Apocalypse, it can be pretty playable
solo.  However, it's still not that much fun.

Bunny Invasion 2: Not as good as the first.

Not quite as good as Last Stand, but still worth playing through once.  Line of
sight is always implemented wrong in the games, for some reason.  Guns are
completely unrealistic and have no relation to their real world counterparts.

A F2P tank "sim" MMO.  Has tons of actual and prototype tanks (mostly)
realistically modeled for the first time in any game.

Okay for what it is, but not worth spending money on for a lot of good reasons:
- Too arcade-like for my tastes.
- The main problem is with the microtransaction model that I'd rather not
  participate in.  I'd rather have just bought the game for a few dollars and
  skipped all of the treadmilling and other artificial paywalls.
- Would be more fun if the distances were much greater and accuracy improved.
  Then it wouldn't need the weird mechanic of enemy tanks being invisible until
  "spotted".
- Getting placed in a random battle where you're completely outranked isn't any
  fun since you have no chance of penetrating the hulls of most of the enemy.
  I've been in matches where I'm literally the only tier 1 tank.
- Has massive amounts of grinding and weird leveling mechanics, like crew
  losing tons of XP when switching vehicles.

I cannot fathom why anyone would spend actual money on this (or waste the
massive amount of time required for grinding), but apparently a lot of people
do just that.

Update: I kept this around to play very occasionally, sticking to a
Leichtraktor through 2 crew experience levels.  From what I can tell, there's
no real point in trying to get a better tank.  The game doesn't actually get
any better than this -- just more expensive.

Though I'm thoroughly bored of normal DayZ, there's a new variant of it up with
a completely different map.  This is probably enough to make things interesting
again for awhile.

Setup (this will probably be out of date very soon):
- Grab this file: <span class="org-link">http://dayzlingor.tk/files/dayz_lingor/@dayz_lingor_v0251.7z</span>
- Extract the @dayz_lingor folder to the OA root folder.
- Download the Lingor Island map from here:
  <span class="org-link">http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=10792</span>
- Put the @lingor folder from that in the OA root folder.
- Grab the map patch from here:
  <span class="org-link">http://www.icebreakr.info/files/lingor_sounds.pbo.lingor14.bisign</span>
- Put that file in @lingor/addons.
- Manually (re)install the most recent beta in order to get a copy of the link
  to launch OA with the Beta patch enabled.
- Got into Expansions and enable all Lingor Island content.  Restart.
- Filter by "lingor" and at least a few servers should come up.  Join one of
  those.
- To play normal DayZ again, go back into Expansions and re-disable all the
  same content.

The main good thing about this mod variant is that all buildings can be
entered.  However, there are some serious downsides to it too:
- The map is much smaller.  Survivor contact is way up as a result.
- Several additional bugs and more of an overall unpolished feel.
- There's currently only a few servers, so getting on is often impossible.
- If you want to loot an area no one is in, you have to wait several minutes
  for the spawns to initialize.
- The jungle environment is probably great for other mods, but feels a little
  wrong for DayZ.  Chernarus is a far more convincing setting.
- Military-grade equipment is far too common.  I'd actually prefer DayZ weapons
  were 90% civilian, with military stuff being insanely rare and highly
  contested for.  More civilian weapons would be needed first though.

Played this for awhile, but got tired of it.  Will possibly check back later if
a lot more progress occurs on this mod variant.

This is a remake of the 1989 game Millennium 2.2.  I was thinking about playing
the original, but this version appears to be feature-complete and obviously
looks and sounds way better.  This also includes some nice features that remove
some serious tedium present in the original.

<span class="org-link">http://glitch01.wordpress.com/</span>

This remake still has a couple problems:
- The computer opponent cheats in order to artificially keep your average ship
  count per colony below 30.
- Some sloppy programming in a couple places.
- Remote colony management is a bit clunky.
- Transporting stuff around kinda sucks.
- Battles can't be skipped.  Normally I'd want to watch them, but they're
  pretty boring here.

This is an okay game, but needs more balancing and strategy to be truly
interesting.

Conceptually excellent tower defense game that includes active participation on
the player's part.  Adds some story elements not typically seen in this genre.

Complaints:
- Map sizes too small and/or game a bit too fast.  Not enough time for
  strategic pondering.
- Would prefer just to place towers rather than engage enemy manually.
- Needs to support higher resolutions.
- Whatever sound lib is being used here errors when initialized.
- The final infinite wave level at the end of each chapter goes way too fast.
  Even with infinite resources, it's impossible to get more than a couple
  minutes into these.

Played quite a bit of this.  I always intended to finish it, but I guess I lost
momentum, since I haven't touched it in years.  I'll close it to clean up
what's probably an abandoned effort.  I think the imprecise nature of the
towers makes me not actually drawn to it, despite its many good points.

A text-based Privateer-clone.  Using the binary Linux port, which to my
surprise, actually worked.  <span class="org-link">http://www.asciisector.net/</span>

Complaints:
- It's impossible to tell NPCs apart in port, since they're all just dots.  A
  smarter system would've been to use special chars for all objects and letters
  for the NPCs with a letter being their first name, maybe with colors used as
  job type or something.
- Released binary-only for no good reason, with no FreeBSD port.  Why anyone
  feels the need to closed-source a text game is beyond me.
- "ASCII" is an acronym and as such, it should be in all capital letters.

Didn't really play this too much.  It's an okay game, I guess, but missing
something that would make it particularly compelling.  Will keep it on
netbooks for emergency boredom alleviation.

Since I picked this up to play DayZ, I might as well play this some.  I sorta
liked Operation Flashpoint, but got frustrated with flying helicopters, put it
aside with the intention of playing it more later, and then never got around to
it again.

Setup:
- Rebind flight controls like this: <span class="org-link">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfciVb_rYHw</span>
  I apparently am unable to not suck at flying helicopters in this game, but
  this control scheme at least makes it possible to not crash (usually with
  multiple reloads).

This is definitely what I've been looking for in a milsim.  I'm actually quite
glad I got this, and can ignore all other FPSes for the foreseeable future as
none can compare to ARMA's realism.

Giving up on the Harvest Red campaign on the final mission.  Two tries of many
hours into it both resulted in bugged states.  It's totally possible to avoid
these issues, but not worth all the retrying for me.  I'm also skipping EW,
since I don't like flying helicopters.  Finished all stock SP missions, minus
Freedom Fighters (which is too imbalanced to be fun, IMO).  This concludes the
base ARMA 2 game for me.  Though a sometimes buggy game, this was definitely
worth playing.

The first expansion to ARMA 2.  The missions here are supposedly superior in
quality to the base game campaign.

This was a better campaign than the original.  I might pick up the Private
Military Company expansion too, since that looks the most promising by far.
I'll wait awhile though, since it's currently $10.  Then if I'm really dying
for more content, I could also pick up the British Armed Forces expansion.

Though like any moddable game, most mods for this one are crap, but I've been
following ARMA 2 long enough now to notice some that are universally highly
regarded and thus probably worth trying.

- ACE: Mega-realism update and tons of extra stuff.  Run the included
  "aceclippi" application while changing settings.  Be sure to at least remap
  the interaction menu buttons.  Follow these instructions (which includes some
  of the following, plus others):
  <span class="org-link">http://www.the-wrecking-crew.co.uk/page/installation</span>
- ACRE: Improved radio.  This is required if I play online (and I'd need a mic
  too).  Probably will skip this though, since I'm not really into MP.
- JSRS: Improved sound.
- ASR AI: Maybe use this to reduce the AI's insane ability to source
  incoming fire.  Installed this from Six Updater as well.

Modding existing missions: There's some missions I think could be good if
modified some.  I don't want to go as far as learning how to create actual mods
though.  See this site for pbo editing tools:

Another Lovecraftian IF game.

<span class="org-link">http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=op0uw1gn1tjqmjt7</span>

One of the best IF games I've ever played, though not perfect.  Also as some
bugs, but these seem not to be game-breaking.

If/when I finish all the expansion packs, try the game with these mods if I
ever want to do another full play-through.  There's a lot of potentially good
mods out there, but given how buggy the game is, it's probably best to keep
them to an absolute minimum.

A World of Pain: <span class="org-link">http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/38719</span>

I may also want to find one that vastly ups the damage of firearms and reduces
ammo availability accordingly.  Having played the game a lot, I'm pretty sure
this would work and make guns more realistic.

Skipping this.  If I want a realistic combat sim, I'll stick with ARMA games.
I'll finish the last expansion pack I bought and call it quits here.

Some promising looking missions/campaigns.

- Escape Chernarus: Turn off any AI mods before playing this.  Trying this just
  by myself.  This is a really good mission to play solo.  Finally beat it
  after many tries, though it wouldn't have taken as many had I forgot to lock
  my server and some n00b showed up and killed me.  Always lock the server.
- The Forgotten Few (campaign): A Chernarus multi-part SP mission.
- Martyrdom 2: Requires Fallujah map.  Install this from Six Updater.  Seems
  nice, but doesn't work properly with ASR AI or something, at least for me.
- Team Shadow (campaign): A sniper campaign.  Looks good, but didn't get around
  to trying it.
- Dynamic Zombie Sandbox: Best ARMA 2 zombie so far.  There's little reason to
  play the others with this available.  I do, however, wish it had DayZ's blood
  system and item collection.  It also needs more stuff to do.

I've almost been defaulting to editing missions now, since there's always some
aspect of them I find unpleasant enough to be worth the effort.

I'm getting a bit bored with ARMA 2, so I'll shelve it until I buy the PMC
expansion.

Gave up last time during this one mission I was having problems with (Titan),
but that was 8 years ago.  The style of space combat here is really unique and
quite well thought out, so I'd like to give it another shot.

Pretty easily beat the Titan mission after a couple tries.  It turns out I was
just getting unlucky before with computer-controlled ship positioning and siege
laser hits.

A few complaints:
- The control scheme could have used a bit more thought.  I'm still not always
  sure what orders override what.
- Some of the lore is a bit shallow/silly (though most of it is pretty good).
- Random stuff happens outside of your control that can ruin a mission.  I
  guess this isn't too bad though, since it's realistic.
- With such a nice universe, it's kind of a shame to experience it through a
  completely linear plot.  Once the missions are done, there's very little
  reason to keep playing this.
- It's a bit difficult to experiment with different builds, since they require
  installing components over multiple missions.
- A lot of realism is included (e.g., stopping requires thrust in the opposite
  direction), but then there's oversights (e.g., continued travel in a single
  direction at a constant speed requires constant thrust).
- Items that show up as available to mount on one ship sometimes aren't on
  another ship of a different class.
- Owned ship shields are bugged in the second to last mission -- they drop when
  you issue a move command.  It's still possible to win without taking losses,
  but struggling against bugs in the final significant battle sucks.
- The second to last mission is pretty bugged (shields randomly dropping and
  getting sucked into the wormhole).  After a dozen reloads trying to work
  around them, I gave up and just watched the ending on a LP.  As the last
  mission isn't really a challenge, I didn't miss anything.

Nexus 2 is currently in development now and is slated for a Q4 2012 release.
I'll probably pick that up when/if it comes out, if it looks competently made.

This is also a popular DayZ map, but I'm just trying out the single player
campaign.

This has thoroughly terrible writing and grammar.  The cut scenes are also
crap.  However, this would be forgivable if not for the frustrating gameplay
issues, mostly involving the custom enemies.  If this was just a milsim mod and
they hadn't bothered with monsters, it would probably be very excellent.  As it
is now though, it's not really worth playing.

I recall this being mostly panned by hardcore RPG addicts at the time it was
released due to being rushed to shelves, which is why I never bought it.  The
problems are now mostly addressed by the Circle of Eight 7.5.0 NC modpack,
which adds new stuff, fixes some bugs, and activates areas that weren't
accessible in the retail version.

Complaints:
- Has lots of bugs, from minor graphical glitches to full crashes and save
  corruption.
- Uses a much smaller subset of the rules system that NWN has.
- Starts off with a massive network of boring fetch quests.  This is avoidable
  by doing the modpack's Welkwood Bog instead, if you avoid a bug of it sending
  you to the wrong place.
- The radial menu system sucks, as does most of the rest of the UI.
- Would've been much more fun as a 2nd edition rules game.
- The game's difficultly (or inability to change it) forces you to powergame
  your party and stats, at least early on.  Having the option to play on
  slightly reduced difficulty and with a more challenging party build could
  have convinced me to replay it (if also not for all the bugs).
- The roll history is vague to the point that you can't tell what's going on.

Notes:
- Activate new content by talking to the Hommlet smith.
- Add Craft Wonderous Item and Craft Magic Arms and Armor for both a wizard and
  cleric.  The loss of 4 feats is more than made up for with the awesome gear.
- Select all stat buff spells on level up since the scrolls don't exist.
- Always up base damage to +3 before adding bonus damage.  Then add burst
  damage before adding normal rolls of the same element.  Elemental
  enchantments max out at 4 types (3 for characters with sneak attack).
- It's lame, but it's best to follow a walkthrough if doing the Hommlet fetch
  quests.  If done in the wrong order you can get forced into getting married.
- Filling NPC party members up with level 0 scrolls is a good way to prevent
  them taking loot, though they'll still take money.  But with the level cap at
  20, it's better to just stick to 5 PC characters.

Despite the problems, this is still a good game and is almost as entertaining
as IWD2, at least with the modpack.  I left some of the new content unfinished,
but between this and NWN, I think I've had enough of the 3.5 ruleset for now.

Has a fully custom 2D isometric engine.

The most famous IF game ever.  Might as well give this a try finally.

Complaints:
- Some of the puzzles in this game are a bit counter-intuitive.  A good IF
  puzzle should require creative and/or lateral thinking.  I guess this is
  somewhat forgivable given that it was among the first.
- Too much trial and error.  There should be clues in the text that make your
  random actions make sense.
- Includes mazes.
- The room layout doesn't lend itself well to map-making.
- Normal play can result in un-winnable states with nothing to indicate such.

Gave up trying to blind-play this once I encountered the first of two mazes, as
randomly guessing directions in those is no fun.  Just finished it with a
walkthrough to read the rest of the game text.  Will be skipping the other Zork
games since they look like they have more of the same flaws.

Setup an L2J server and see how far it's come since then.  I definitely won't
actually bother playing it more than just a little though.  The last time I
looked, it was playable, but just barely.

Client guide: <span class="org-link">http://www.westknights.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=34&amp;t=2208</span>

Tasks:
- Upgraded Java to 1.7.  Updated JAVA_HOME and PATH.
- Upgraded Eclipse to Juno while I was at it.  Note that the JDK upgrade
  requires editing the specified JRE under "External Tools" in the drop-down
  next to the "Run" button.  This wipes out my Counterclockwise/Leiningen
  setup, but I wasn't using it anyway.
- Grabbed an unstable snapshot of L2J server and datapack, since I probably
  won't bother changing any code.
- Put database locally on Windows so as not to gunk up cellblock.
- Merged in the game client system directory changes.
- Updated hosts file to redirect to localhost.
- Respawn is way too fast.  Running this fixes that: update spawnlist set
  respawn_delay = (respawn_delay * 3);

Got the server up after some work.  There's definitely still a lot of features
missing in the emulator, but the core game seems to be there.

Complaints about Lineage 2:
- Item tiers by level + enchanting doesn't really work.  Item tiers are pretty
  dumb in the first place, IMO.
- Has leveled XP and even drops.  I've always felt this turned an otherwise
  open world into one where you progress through small parts of it that were
  worth visiting.  It also has implications for farming needed drops.
- Enchanting is a huge timesink for no good reason.
- Has all kinds of random, weird systems that make no sense and are explained
  nowhere.  Basically, it's full of the wrong kind of complexity.  I'm sure
  it'd be fine for people that've played this for years, but much of the
  mechanics of these are impenetrable for the newbie.
- Targeting and movement and are sloppy and imprecise.
- Too group-centric.  In L1, almost everything was solo-able with the right
  character, though grouping still had it's benefits.  Here, if you want to
  solo, you're simply locked out of the majority of interesting content,
  especially late game.
- There's really no original ideas in this game.  It's all been done before,
  and with less mindless grinding.

There's a lot of little things wrong with L2, but these are the big ones.
Despite the problems, it's okay for a minor MMO fix, but there are far better
options out there.

Played a lot of Angband back in the 1990s.  Giving it another look to see if I
want to keep playing it (or, more likely, its variants).  Installed on FreeBSD,
but tiles and multiple windows don't work there.  It's still playable, but the
other windows do make life easier, so I'm mainly using the Windows version.

This is still fun, but my main problem with it is that I'd prefer levels not be
regenerated when revisiting floors (I forgot how annoying that was).  There are
also definitely better variants now that make the experience more interesting.
I've reviewed the entire list and am thinking about checking out (in order of
currently perceived likelihood of being good) Unangband, Z+Angband, and
Hengband (seems dead now).  However, none of these seem as good as ToME.

One of the more actively developed Angband-variants.  This has been recently
updated to a more original setting and renamed to Tales of Maj'Eyal, so I'm
playing that on Windows.  <span class="org-link">http://tome.te4.org/</span>

This is one of the best games I've ever played.  There's some minor things
about it that could be improved, however:
- I grabbed the code for this and it looks clean enough, but the many
  unforeseen interactions beg for some more formal way of modeling game state.
  If done right, this would fix the many Lua errors, most of which seem to
  involve operations on null values.
- Some of the gimmick dungeons, like the Sandworm Lair, get old after playing
  them a zillion times.
- Stun/freeze and confusion immunity is a bit too important.  Almost every
  build has to prioritize finding items for this.  In most games, death is
  guaranteed by Darkfell due to not getting lucky on immunity drops.  The only
  recourse is then to farm up items for days in the Ruined Dungeon.
- Summoners and minion necromancers could be awesome, but are too annoying to
  play due to pathfinding and space issues.
- While enemies scale in level with you, you still mostly fight the same ones
  over and over.  Towards the end of the game, you'll be encountering level 50
  rats, wolves, and bears.  I'd rather see new monster types at higher levels.
- The level cap is hit too quickly.  I hit the cap on my winning run with still
  many plot dungeons to go.  Had I farmed the farportal, I could have easily
  hit it before ever leaving for the Far East.
- I'd prefer the game be easier but only have rougelike mode.  The game seems
  to be designed around the assumption that you will use multiple lives.

This is so far removed from Angband, it's barely a variant at all apart from
some superficial similarities.  I finally managed to beat it with a Cornac
Solipsist on easy mode.  I'll come back some time in the future and try winning
with a different class.  Development is still active, so there will be a lot
different in a couple years.

A curses-based typing tutor.  This might improve my speed/accuracy some.

This did help some with numbers and special characters.  I noticed that I'm
faster with the Das Keyboard, but more accurate with the IBM Model M, probably
due to the difference in key pressure needed.  This was mildly entertaining for

Several other Angband variants are better than this, but this is ported to
FreeBSD, so I'll play it some.

The port of this is much better than when I last played and, unlike normal
Angband, runs (mostly) properly on FreeBSD.

Zangband is pretty unforgiving.  While I can consistently get a character to
around mid-level, getting the required setup to go deeper tends to be much
tougher.  In the meantime, I'll usually die farming the mobs that could
potentially drop the stuff I need (typically from one of the effects I'm trying
to get resistance to).  Add the low encumbrance, particularly of non-STR chars,
plus mobs that steal massive amounts of GP and this gets especially tiresome.
If it weren't for these things, it'd be a decent Angband variant.  I'll keep
this around as my main game on the system until I get back into Nethack, but
probably won't play it much anymore.

The plan here was to stay in Afghanistan until 2012-11-26.  I was fully aware
that it would be unlikely that this would work out as nicely for any number of
possible things that could go wrong.  As suspected, something did, and I'll
have been in country for around 204 days.  This is still plenty of time though,
as my original goal was to spend at least 6 months there.

I got what I wanted out of it, which was a large pile of money.  While the pile
could have been bigger, as planned in ideas.org, I've been raising the bar on
what I'm willing to suffer in exchange for money now, and conditions there had
gotten really, really bad.  Though I'm now technically financially independent,
I do still want to finish my targeted buffer before retiring completely, but I
intend to do that in a manner where I incur the least possible suffering for it
(time is not as much of a factor now, since I could realistically walk away
whenever I wanted to).

Events evolved after my leaving such that it became clear that I wouldn't have
been able to milk my position there for much more than I already did.  So,
there's no regrets about anything that happened as I pretty much achieved a
near optimal outcome.

It's always a good idea to have one of these handy.  That way if your employer
insists you do something you'd rather not, you just pull this out and the
problem is solved.  In my case, I probably don't want another job and could
just say "I quit", but there's no sense in limiting options needlessly.
Besides, I'm pretty much beyond caring what impressions I leave on passing
scenery, like former coworkers.

Wrote a letter in LaTeX (which makes letter markup pretty painless) and waited
a few days and reviewed the wording.  It's pretty much perfect now without
being too long.  It's also written in a manner that lends itself to generic,
completely voluntary resignation.  Will print this out, sign it, and carry it

I'm skeptical about these, but I'll give the cheap ones a try first and see if

track productivity very closely, I suspect I'm less likely to be fooled by it.
The fact that the better nootropics definitely have an effect isn't disputed.
The part I'm mainly skeptical of is whether or not they result in an increase
of the productive kinds of mental activity.  For example, caffeine gives one a
stimulus boost, but unless I'm about to fall asleep, it doesn't really help me
write better code or retain more information, and too much of it just results
in useless scatterbrain non-thinking.  There is also some definite snake oil in
the herbal/supplement side of nootropics, so I'm only sticking with stuff
confirmed by studies.  A good self-study is here (though it's not
even single-blind): <span class="org-link">http://www.gwern.net/Nootropics</span>

One impetus for this is that I currently like nicotine's (very mild) nootropics
effects and would like to replace that with something that doesn't murder me.
Apart from the physical addiction, I know from experience that absent nicotine,
I'm much lazier.  If this works, it'll save money too.

First I want to establish effectiveness by targeting 2 nutrients essential for
mental health and then adding the most basic racetam.
- Supplemental intake of Choline Bitartrate of 500mg/day (2 doses).  I'm
  starting with GNC Choline 250.  If I stick with this, find a cheaper source.
- Supplemental intake of Omega-3 of 850mg/day.  Since I don't want to eat fish
  oil, I'm going for flaxseed oil (which I got a ton of for cheap at the
  grocery store).  Flaxseed (not the oil) is super cheap and doesn't go bad.
  If I stick with this, I'll order some bulk on Amazon.
- After 3 weeks of the above, add piracetam of 800mg/day (1 dose) and up the
  Choline by 250-500mg.  Do this for 2 weeks and if working well, go to 2
  piracetam doses per day and up to double the Choline.  After 3-4 weeks, take
  the weekends off of piracetam and just take 250-500mg Choline.

After 1 month on piracetam, review stuff accomplished on it (both at work and
home).  If improvement is noticeable, order bulk powder of piracetam and
continue use for another 6 months.  Reevaluate at that time and consider trying
other racetams or otherwise redoing my stack.

Update: These don't seem to do anything for me.  They do have an effect, but it
doesn't seem beneficial -- more just making me feel a bit spaz-like.  At least,
they definitely don't increase focus for me.

<span class="org-level-3">*** </span><span class="ATTRLIST-1">DONE</span><span class="org-level-3"> year-end review for 2012</span>
    - State "DONE"       <span class="org-date">[2012-12-29 Sat 17:01]</span>
Observations for 2012:
- This year's work life was divided into Afghanistan, a transition period on a
  temporary project, and going back to DARPA for the rest of it.
- Due to being in Afghanistan, I lost a lot of time for doing stuff that's
  actually interesting.  However, since I made a ton of cash, it'll result in
  earlier retirement and more stuff getting done overall in life.
- I've been incrementally increasing the minimal tolerance level for
  work-related suckage.  This has actually had excellent results.  By clearly
  stating that I'm not interested in bending over when an employers requests a
  "favor", I ended up getting an extra +12% raise along with other
  accommodations.  My analysis here is that this is still risky for wage slaves
  (you have to be ready to call a bluff, after all), but its risk/reward ratio
  is a net gain and I wish I'd been doing this all along, even when I didn't
  have the hand to back it up.
- Overall, this was yet another year of painful working, commuting, and putting
  up with annoying employees and work bureaucracy.  However, it was definitely
  worth it.  I can now quit working whenever I want, but my target date at
  the current wealth gathering rate is early to mid 2014 (I'd quit earlier, but
  getting some income in the next year makes sense for tax reasons).

Major goals for next year:
- The end is in sight.  Start thinking about what I want to do post-work.
  Prioritize all tasks here that have post-work value and minimize those that
  are work-specific.  If I'm still working by the end of year, this will change
  to practically ignoring all work-specific skills.  Organize my current ideas
  into a written plan.
- Be ready to resign at any time.  Despite engineering my work experience as
  best I can from an employee position, there's only so much that can be done.
  I'm at the point now where I can safely walk away at any time, and I
  definitely should if the suck ever reaches critical mass.  While I don't have
  everything planned out yet, I've thought more than enough about post-work
  life to know I'll be okay.  Taxes and other types of milking are increasing
  starting next year anyway, so working is going to be much less worthwhile.
- Decide on which Lisp variant to commit to.
- Start on completing personal research tasks that involve languages I don't
  want to use for the rest of my life.  This includes the ML-variants, Scheme,
  and logic-based language work.

Supposedly a rather crappy book, so just reading the introduction parts
(chapters 1-3).  See the Hibernate entry under Work-Related Topics for how this
fits in to fully learning this topic.  I only have this e-book as a .chm file,
making reading it especially inconvenient, but a coworker had a hard copy, so
I'm borrowing that.  If I just skim this, I'll use the Hibernate Recipes book
for a more comprehensive read.

Update: Read some of this, but my gawd it's boring.  I think I have enough of a
hang of Hibernate now that I can stop reading up on it in my spare time, but
this was mostly due to actually using it.  One approach I didn't use was to
design my POJOs first and then have Hibernate generate my DDL from that.  I
think I prefer it the other way though.

For me, this could have been called "Learn Python the Boring Way".  It'd be a
marginally okay book for an absolute beginner though.  Managed to slog through
the whole thing.  Code is in ~/src/repo/python/lpthw.

Notes:
- Use `pydoc &lt;identifier&gt;' to get documentation on any built-in functions,
  modules, packages, or dotted reference.  These are pretty good, but really
  need the exception info at the top.
- Creating a file full of functions with doc strings then running `import' in
  the interpreter against the file name (minus extension) allows you to run
  `help(file)' to get a full function list with documentation.  Note that in
  iPython in Emacs, this requires the key commands to scroll (f, b).
- Use `type()' to check types.
- Always at least declare classes with `class ClassName(object)', to inherit
  from the object type.
- Created the project skeleton and copied it to ~/src/python/skeleton.  Added a
  README.txt file that lists the steps necessary to use it.
- To use nose, tests have to be in &lt;project_dir&gt;/tests/BLAH_tests.py.  Each
  module should have one test file (if needed).
- __init__.py files are needed in each directory that contains stuff in a
  package.  See ex50 for a proper example.
- To use setup.py on a per user basis, run something like `python setup.py
  install --user'.

I made the mistake of assuming "hard" meant something similar to "theoretically
rigorous", and was disappointed to find it meant "repetitious" and/or
"tedious".  This is my own fault though, since Python isn't that kind of
language, nor is the author that kind of person, and I knew both of these
things beforehand.  The writing here also is pretty sloppy and needs some
serious proof-reading.  The exercises are often rather stupid (e.g. reading
stuff out loud), so I skipped the ones that I felt were of no value (about 1/3
of them).  I'd also disagree with this method of even teaching programming,
since it focuses on language specifics and wrote memorization instead of
building up a framework of computer science fundamentals.  Maybe if the target
audience was learning that stuff elsewhere, this book would be an okay intro to
Python syntax.  The later chapters on how to structure a Python project are
pretty useful though.

This book is really more of a desk reference, and I've been using it for that
for a few years now.  I'm just giving Part I (chapters 1-11) a quick read to
complete my base Python knowledge.

Notes:
- A `,' at the end of a print skips the CR/LF, but it also inserts a space
  between print output.
- `yeild' can be used to create "generator functions".  An example given is a
  program that mimics the `tail' Unix utility.  Another thing it can be used
  for is coroutines, which can save on creating threads.
- Use dir() to inspect objects, including (with no argument) the toplevel.
- __name__() functions implement language operations (e.g. __add__() on lists,
  implement +).  These are usually documented in the type's pydoc.
- __new__(): constructor, __init__(): initializer, __del__(): destructor.
  Normally, __new__() and __del__() aren't declared in user-defined classes.
- Use the @staticmethod decorator just before a method to make it static.
- __name variables are private class members.
- If I'm writing code with Unicode string literals, use a comment at the first
  or second line of the file with `-*- coding: UTF-8 -*-'.
- Use isinstance() to check types, as it is aware of inheritance.
- Use copy.deepcopy() to clone objects.
- Use range() for a sequence of numbers, xrange() is a lazy-evaluated version
  of the same.
- Use `with' statements to execute a series of statements within a runtime
  context controlled by an object that serves as a context manager.  This
  includes files, locks, and connections.  For example:
  with threading.lock():
      &lt;several statements here&gt;
- Closures work like they do elsewhere.  The environment in which it was
  defined, not executed, determines the value of variables.  It's always
  possible to check a function's environment with func_name.__globals__.
- It's possible to make your own @decorators, which is just shorthand for a
  function that wraps the decorated function.
- Lambda syntax is `lambda args : expression', e.g. `f = lambda x,y : x + y'.
- To have properties with accessors/mutators in classes, use the @property
  decorator on a function by the name of the property, and add a
  &lt;prop_name&gt;.setter or &lt;prop_name&gt;.deleter.  There's another method that
  involves the property() function.
- It's possible to dynamically import modules.  This makes it possible to have
  two modules with the same name for a function or class, and have the
  implementation applied based on some conditional.
- Whenever any part of a package (a directory of modules) is imported, the
  __init__.py file is executed.  It's important that this contain at least a
  declaration like `__all__ = ["module1", "module2"]' to handle * imports.

This is decent book for learning Python, and I probably should have just read
this one (or even just the official Python docs) and found some exercises
elsewhere.

Until now, I had only used this for a reference (as I'd already read a few
other Emacs books).  Reading this from start to end (skipping the parts I
already know completely or for modes I don't use) and making notes of anything
I spot that will be useful in everyday life.  Since I plan to use Emacs until
death, time spent learning more useful commands is never time wasted.

Online at <span class="org-link">http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html</span> which
is the same as the Emacs info page (C-h i m Emacs).

Notes:
- To send a numeric argument to a command prefix with M-&lt;digit&gt;.  To send a
  multi-digit argument to a command, continue the numeric prefix while holding
  Meta.  To send a negative numeric command, use M-- (e.g. M-- 9 C-n scrolls up
  9 lines).  C-u can start and end a numeric prefix too.
- Prefix normal commands with C-u to multiply them by 4.  Subsequent C-u
  prefixes multiply further (e.g. C-u C-u C-n scrolls down 16 lines).
- Use C-u M-q to fill-paragraph and justify.
- C-x z calls repeat, which repeats the last command.  Prefixing this with a
  numeric argument can be rather handy.  You can also run repeat and hit `z' as
  many times as necessary to continue repeating.
- C-s and C-r work in the minibuffer for M-x history.
- Browse the E-Lisp libraries with C-h p.
- C-x C-x swaps point and mark and selects.  Especially handy after C-&lt;SPC&gt;
  C-&lt;SPC&gt; or C-y.
- Useful mark commands: M-@ (mark-word), M-h (mark-paragraph).
- Use M-m to jump to the first non-whitespace character in indented code
  (easier than C-a TAB).
- Use the mark ring to get back to previous spots of interest in a file.  Set a
  mark point without activating it with C-&lt;SPC&gt; C-&lt;SPC&gt;.  Then use C-u C-&lt;SPC&gt;
  to jump to previous marks.  I've setq-ed set-mark-command-repeat-pop to t in
  ~/.emacs in order to allow for mark ring traversal without popping them off
  the stack.
- Use M-^ to join lines.
- C-S-backspace kills whole line.  This is easier than C-a C-k C-k, but doesn't
  work in terminal sessions inside urxvt (due to control-shift being captured).
  Next time I recompile urxvt, flag configure with --disable-iso14755.
- View the contents of the kill-ring with C-h v kill-ring.
- Text accumulation functions can be handy if copying a bunch of regions to a
  buffer, mostly with M-x append-to-buffer (along with several others).
- Rectangle region commands: C-x r k (kill-rectangle), C-x r y
  (yank-rectangle), C-x r c (clear-rectangle), M-x string-insert-rectangle.
- Registers: These are single-letter named places to store content.  They can
  be useful for collecting or repeatedly yanking in a macro (and other uses).
  Useful commands include C-x r s r (copy-to-register), C-x r i r
  (insert-register), and M-x append-to-register, where the last r is the
  register name.
- M-x visual-line-mode enables word-wrap (instead of the normal line-wrap).
- After searching, C-u C-&lt;SPC&gt; moves back to the pre-search point.
- M-e (forward-sentence), M-a (backward-sentence), M-} (forward-paragraph), M-{
  (backward-paragraph), M-k (kill-sentence), C-x &lt;DEL&gt;
  (backward-kill-sentence).
- M-r (move-to-window-line) with no args will move to the center of the window.
- C-h C-h b will show the active keymap.  
- In isearch, use C-q to enter control characters (e.g. C-q C-j to add ^J to
  the search string for line breaks).  Use C-w and C-y to pull in additional
  words or lines.
- Transposing: M-t (transpose-words), C-x C-t (transpose-lines).
- Spelling: M-$ (ispell-word).
- Use M-x auto-revert-tail-mode to tail -f a file by putting the cursor at the
  end and enabling this mode.  This updates every 5 seconds.
- M-x diff-backup will diff a file with its previous backups.  Very handy.
- Use emerge for merging files.  Commands are similar to ediff (a, b, n, q,
  etc.).  May want to set this up as git's merge tool later (added a task).  I
  think I still prefer ediff for more simple operations though.
- To edit over FTP, use C-x C-f /<span class="org-link">ftp:user@host:/path/to/file</span>.  The same syntax
  works for other protocols.
- /: can also be used for quoted file names, e.g. /:/home/me/$5%~.txt.
- Window resizing commands: C-x { (enlarge-window-horizontally), C-x }
  (shrink-window-horizontally), C-x ^ (enlarge-window), C-x +
  (balance-windows), M-x shrink-window (maybe rebind C-x - to this).
- After using mouse-3 to select a region, a second mouse-3 in the same place
  will kill the region.
- M-^ (delete indentation) will merge the current line to the previous and
  delete the indentation (basically the opposite of C-j).
- M-o M-s (center-line).
- When filling paragraphs, use C-x . to set the fill prefix (usually, the
  number of spaces that should precede each line), then running M-q.  The fill
  prefix is set to whatever is between the line beginning and the point though,
  so it can be used for any kind of fill (e.g. program comments).  Be sure to
  clear it (C-a C-x .) if I don't want to keep it active in that buffer.
- Use M-x longlines-mode to create files with long lines that aren't saved with
  newlines (only displaying soft newlines).
- C-h S (info-lookup-symbol) will scan the info files for the symbol searched
  for.  This is useful for languages with info pages installed, like elisp.
- To refresh the woman manpage scan (used for completion), send woman a numeric
  argument.
- Use eldoc-mode when programming elisp to auto-display function argument
  lists in the echo area.
- Use M-n and M-p in compilation buffers to navigate to errors without
  selecting the source buffer.  C-x ` and M-g p do the same but do select it.

Review these notes occasionally until I've internalized all of these new
commands in my standard Emacs command lexicon.  I may even read this manual
again in a few years to pick up stuff I didn't find interesting this time (like
some of the advanced query commands, GUD, GTK customization, etc.).

I may read Hadoop in Action after this and possibly Pro Hadoop after that
(though the latter is supposedly not that great).  Apparently, I have an older
version of this book, missing the chapter on Hive, so I might pick up a hard
copy (as I'm going to be using this regularly), but I'll give the other books a
look first to see if they cover the missing stuff.

Notes:
- The org.apache.hadoop.io package contains the Hadoop types (optimizing for
  network serialization).  Use these types with generics in the
  org.apache.hadoop.mapred package.  Within my map() and reduce() functions,
  convert these to Java base types to manipulate them and back to the Hadoop
  types on the way out.
- Mapper/Reducer classes: Mapper&lt;KeyIn, ValueIn, KeyOut, ValueOut&gt;,
  Reducer&lt;KeyIn, ValueIn, KeyOut, ValueOut&gt;.  Mapper.Context and
  Reducer.Context are passed into map() and reduce().  These contain various
  context fields/methods and write output.
- Required components of a MapReduce program:
  - A MyMapper class with a map() method.
  - A MyReducer class with a reduce() method.
  - A third class that runs the job. 
- Combiner functions: Filters map() output locally on the data node.  Can be
  used to optimize amount of data xferred.  Not applicable to certain kinds of
  algorithms.
- Using Hadoop Streaming makes testing much easier, since you can just run it
  outside of Hadoop to test.
- See pg. 55 for an example of testing the full workflow using Unix pipes.
- See pg. 56 for a streaming command line example.
- Maybe check out Dumbo (<span class="org-link">http://klbostee.github.com/dumbo/</span>) for writing
  MapReduce programs in Python.
- Run `hadoop fsck -blocks' to check cloud health.
- Namenodes can be backed up two ways, by writing persistent state to two
  filesystems (one local, one NFS mounted) and by configuring a secondary
  namenode as a failover (which lags a little, probably causing some data
  loss).
- The 2nd column from the output of `hadoop fs -ls' is the replication count
  (corresponds to dfs.replication in core-site.xml).
- Import org.apache.hadoop.dfs.MiniDFSCluster to create an in-process HDFS
  cluster (for testing purposes).
- A distance metric (node, rack, datacenter) is used to determine latency of
  requests instead of bandwith measurements.
- For HDFS reads, the HDFS client gets the first few block locations from the
  namenode, then reads blocks directly from the data nodes.  The DFSInputStream
  (returned from FSDataInputStream) finds the next block internally.  See
  pg. 63 for full details.
- For HDFS writes, the HDFS client creates the new file entry on the namenode
  (blocks not yet assigned), then the DFSOutputStream (returned from
  FSDataOutputStream) splits the data into packets andwrites then to the
  internal data queue, which is consumed by the DataStreamer (which asks the
  namenode to allocate blocks).  DataStreamer streams the packet to the
  datanode, and if replication is enabled, that node will pass it along after
  writing to the next node.  After this completes successfully, an ack is sent
  back to the DataStreamer, whence it is removed from its internal ack queue.
- To ensure data is actually written to HDFS, either an explicit sync() must be
  called, or close() (which performs an implicit sync()).
- For parallel copying of files in HDFS, used distcp (a MapReduce job).  An
  example use case is parallel copying between two clusters.
- Use the balancer to rebalance a cluster.
- Use HAR (Hadoop Archive) files to collect many smaller files (as small files
  eat up namenode space).  Collect files with `hadoop archive -archiveName
  files.har /my/files /user/hadoop'.  This will create a files.har in
  /user/hadoop.  Look at the contents of the HAR with `hadoop fs -lsr
  har:///user/hadoop/files.har' or `hadoop fs -lsr
  har://hdfs-localhost:8020/user/hadoop/files.har'.  Use -rmr (recursive rm) to
  delete HAR files, since they're stored considered directories by Hadoop.  HAR
  files cannot be updated.
- Disable checksums (probably should never do this, due to the numerous failure
  points) by passing false to FileSystem.setVerifyChecksum();
- Use the various Hadoop types derived from the Writable interface to write
  various data, providing it with the serialization Hadoop expects.  See
  starting at pg. 110 for complete info.
- When serializing, always use the Hadoop serialization
  (e.g. org.apache.hadoop.io.serializer.WritableSerialization).
- File-based data structures: SequenceFile and MapFile are two specialized data
  structures.  A SequenceFile can be handy for, say, a log file that includes
  binary data, but it's main benefit is as a way to collect many small files.
  A MapFile is the same, but sorted to permit lookups.  For SequenceFiles or
  MapFiles with binary data, use SequenceFileInputFormat (such as its variant,
  SequenceFileBinaryInputFormat).
- MapReduce writing workflow: Write map and reduce functions with unit tests.
  Write the driver program to manage the job, including the ability to run it
  from the IDE with test data (thus making it debuggable).  If the controller
  fails, expand the unit tests to cover the cause.  Then try it on the cluster.
  When non-obvious errors occur here, debug them using something like
  IsolationRunner.  It's possible to attach a debugger to Hadoop as well (look
  into this).  Finally, attempt to make the tasks run faster, perhaps by using
  task profiling (some of which Hadoop provides).
- A Configuration can be read from an XML resource file.  See pg. 116 for the
  structure.  The defaults for the system are defined in core-default.xml
  (contained internally), the defaults for the site are in core-site.xml.
  These conf files can be used for switching between clusters when running
  projects.  A good practice is to make a hadoop-local.xml (local FS and
  jobtracker), hadoop-localhost (namenode and jobtracker running on localhost),
  and hadoop-cluster.xml (actual addresses).  Use these from the CLI with
  hadoop's -conf flag.  Use -D on the CLI to change these properties
  individually (include a space, unlike -D for the JVM).  The conf file can
  even include the map and reduce classes.
- IDE setup: Unpack the distribution, then add the distro's lib directory to
  the classpath.  For Eclipse, there's a Hadoop plugin for MapReduce/HDFS
  integration at: <span class="org-link">http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/EclipsePlugIn</span>
- This book suggests Mockito for unit tests, but it doesn't seem necessary.
- Running jobs: A command like `hadoop jar job.jar pkg.MainClass -conf
  conf/hadoop-localhost.xml input/all.csv output.txt'.  In this example, if
  job.jar had the main class defined in the manifest, it wouldn't need the
  pkg.MainClass parameter.
- The jobtracker page (<span class="org-link">http://localhost:50030/jobtracker.jsp</span>) includes a full
  history of up to 100 jobs (configurable by the
  mapred.jobtracker.completeuser.job.maximum property).
- Chukwa is a Hadoop log analyzer.
- Use Reporter.setStatus() to set the task status in the jobtracker page.
- See the various logs in $HADOOP_HOME/logs for various types of logging.
  logs/userlogs have the logs for specific attempts.
- Remote debugging: Set the configuration property keep.failed.task.files to
  true.  This has the tasktracker keep enough info to be able to rerun on the
  same input data.  Run the job again and note which node the task fails on and
  the ID (attempt_*) using the web UI.  Then use IsolationRunner with those
  retained files as input (saved to mapred.local.dir, under
  taskTracker/jobcache/job-ID/task-attempt-ID).  Then allow the remote debugger
  to connect using `export
  HADOOP_OPTS="-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=8000'.
  Suspend makes it wait until the debugged is connected.  Now re-launch the
  task with `hadoop org.apache.hadoop.mapred.IsolationRunner ../job.xml'.  To
  keep task data for non-failing tasks, edit keep.task.files.pattern to a regex
  that will match the IDs of the tasks I want to keep.
- See table 5-3 for a tuning checklist.
- A convenience method to start jobs is JobClient.runJob(conf).  This calls
  submitJob().
- The TaskRunner (an instance of which is created by the tasktracker) starts a
  new JVM to run each map or reduce task, allowing for no interference with its
  own.  It's possible to reuse JVMs between tasks though.
- Jobs and tasks each have a status, which can be checked to determine the
  state (running, successfully completed, failed), progress, counters, status
  message, etc.  For example, JobClient.runJob() returns a RunningJob instance,
  which has various status methods, like mapProgress() and reduceProgress().
- For site configuration, look at the various -default.xml files in the src.
  These have the full configuration options.
- Hadoop has a choice between the FIFO scheduler (the default) and the Fair
  Scheduler, which is more suited for a multi-user environment.
- If map functions are outputting a lot of data, it may make sense to enable
  compression on it to lower the amount of data to transfer to the reducer.
  Set mapred.compress.map.output to true to do this.
- Enable skipping mode (via the SkipBadRecords class), if it's not possible to
  skip them (due to some 3rd-party library).  Ideally, these should be filtered
  in the map function.
- In a Python script, grab environmental variables with
  `os.environ["mapred_job_id"]'.  Note that the "." characters are converted to
  underscores.
- Function types:
  map: (K1, V1) -&gt; list(K2, V2)
  combine: (K2, list(V2)) -&gt; list(K2, V2)
  reduce: (K2, list(V2)) -&gt; list(K3, V3)
  partition: (K2, V2) -&gt; integer
- The default for map and reduce is to do nothing.  This can be useful if it's
  just necessary to do one of either.
- The default seperator between keys and values is a tab.  This can be changed
  for both the mapper and reducer, on both input and output.
- To disable file splitting (potentially necessary on some map functions, like
  ones that sort the contents) subclass FileInputFormat and override
  isSplitable() to return false.  See other similar customizations on pg. 185.
- TextInputFormat is the default InputFormat.  It takes text file input and
  considers each line the value, with the key being an integer representing the
  offset.  KeyValueTextInputFormat is slightly more useful, as it assumes the
  key is at the beginning of the line, separated from the value text by a
  delimiter (tab being the default).
- If long tasks are timing out (they're normally expected to report progress
  every 10min or they'll be killed), just write status messages on it.
- List Hadoop jobs from the CLI with `hadoop job -list'.  To kill a job, run
  `hadoop job -kill jobId'.
- Use DistributedCache to disseminate jars/files to each node at job submission
  time.
- MapReduce provides a bunch of built-in features, such as counters (for input
  records, output records, records skipped, and many other things), sorting
  (via the sort stage, which can be programmed to, including in streaming with
  Python), joins (though Hive is easier for this), the DistributedCache (with
  the -files flag on the job call.  See example for accessing datafiles
  starting on pg. 239), and various MapReduce library classes.
- Apache ZooKeeper: A "distributed coordination service".  See notes under
  Apache ZooKeeper task.
- If Hadoop gets stuck in safe mode forever, try `hadoop dfsadmin -safemode
  leave'.

Skipping Hadoop setup/administration, Pig, HBase, and Cloudera, for now.

    - State "STARTED"    <span class="org-date">[2011-05-06 Fri 07:14]</span>
Notes:
- Weka assumes input data is a flat file or relation, each data point being
  represented by a fixed number of attributes.  Weka can also use as input the
  results from a database query.
- Datasets, the fundamental machine learning data structure -- typically a
  2-dimensional array, can contain these attributes in Weka: nominal
  (predefined values), numeric (real, integer, numeric), string (enclosed in
  double quotes), date, and relational.
- ARFF syntax: Created a test.arff file, added to GitHub.
- See examples (on GNU/Linux) in /usr/share/doc/weka/examples.
- To validate and run some basic stats on an ARFF file, run `java
  weka.core.Instances soybean.arff'.
- To import a CSV file into an ARFF file automagically, run `java
  weka.core.converters.CSVLoader data.csv &gt; data.arff'.
- Send -h to any Weka class to get its command line parameters.
- A classifier is a mapping from all-but-one dataset attribute to the class
  attribute, specifics varying between classifiers.
- Folds: These provide an alternative training method vs. independent
  training/test sets.  The data is split into n folds and one is randomly
  chosen for testing, while the other n - 1 folds are used for training.
  Results are then averaged over all folds.
- Use the weka.filters package to add/remove attributes, in supervised and
  unsupervised form.  weka.filters.supervised is for supervised filtering,
  which can take advantage of class information (default behavior with `-c
  last').  Example: java weka.filters.unsupervised.instance.Resample -i
  data/soybean.arff -o soybean-5%.arff -Z 5
- For classifiers, if `-T test_file' is left out, a cross-validation will occur
  on the input data.  This file needs to redefine the attributes.
- Confusion matrix (contingency table): Correctly classified instances are the
  sum of the diagonals.
- For classifiers, -i is useful, since it shows the TP (true positive), FP Rate
  (false positive rate), etc.
- For big jobs, use -Xmx1024m to ensure the task has enough memory.
- If I have a bunch of classifier output in .out files, having run stuff like
  `java weka.classifiers.trees.J48 -t soybean.arff -x 5 -i -k &gt; test.out', I
  can run something like `cat test.out | grep -A 3 "Stratified" | grep
  "^Correctly"'.  Doing this on all my .out files will give me a list from
  which I can tell which classifier is the best.
- GUI tools:
  - Explorer: Standard Weka tool.
  - Experimenter: Tool for testing between different learning schemes.
  - KnowledgeFlow: Same as Explorer, but with drag-and-drop.
  - SimpleCLI: CLI for systems like Windows.
  - ArffViewer: Tool for viewing ARFF files in table view.
- To save an image while looking at it from the Visualize tab, use
  S-M-&lt;mouse-1&gt;.  If in Gnome, disable the movement key in
  System-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Window.
- Right click on entries in the Result List for various options, like
  visualizing the results.
- In scatter plots, jitter introduces random displacement on points, possibly
  allowing for concentrations to be more obvious (like if many points are at
  the same spot).
- Declare date attributes with `@ATTRIBUTE timestamp DATE "yyyy-MM-dd
  HH:mm:ss"'.  In the data, this attribute will then look something like
  `"2001-04-03 12:12:12"'.

Skipped chapters on Experimenter, KnowledgeFlow, Bayesian network classifiers,
and the Appendix.  May read these later (particularly the Bayesian network
classifiers chapter).

Already glanced at the decompiled Stuxnet code which definitely supports the
supposition that it was written by a professional team of developers using a
iterative development process with extensive debugging/testing.  I've seen
plenty of other amateur exploit code, and this looks more like something I'd
see at work.  This professional analysis might have made some interesting
additional observations.

TMP file note: I don't buy the suggestion (made by Cryptome) that "myrtus"
means "My RTUs", as programmers don't structure their directories the way it's
used in that path.  This implies that it's either a username, project code name
(my guess), or a red herring.  If not the latter, then it's probably of Israeli
origin.  It's almost definitely a product of some Western nation-state, since
the literals used therein are the type seen by English-speakers.  However,
references to "futbol" imply non-US origin, though everyone in the US knows
about the rest of the world's soccer fixation.

Pretty interesting program, but this paper doesn't really do that great of a
job describing it.  Generally, I'm not interested in reading post-mortems like
these, particularly not on Windows, but made an exception here, due to this
being the most advanced targeted attack to date and having implications related
to my field of work.

Update: The NYT supposedly confirmed that Stuxnet was a join US/Israeli
operation, with development in the US and config/deployment by Israel.

Some learned wisdom here, though I semi-disagree with the Lisp criticisms.

My favorites:
19. A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is not
    worth knowing.
34. The string is a stark data structure and everywhere it is passed there is
    much duplication of process. It is a perfect vehicle for hiding
    information.
39. Re graphics: A picture is worth 10K words - but only those to describe the
    picture. Hardly any sets of 10K words can be adequately described with
    pictures.
40. Some programming languages manage to absorb change, but withstand progress.
54. Beware of the Turing tar-pit in which everything is possible but nothing of
    interest is easy.
93. When someone says "I want a programming language in which I need only say
    what I wish done," give him a lollipop.
94. Interfaces keep things tidy, but don't accelerate growth: Functions do.
95. Don't have good ideas if you aren't willing to be responsible for them.

A coworker attended this class and recommends the material.  Slides in a file
called common_mistakes_in_statistics-2011.pdf.

Notes:
- The file drawer problem: The problem that studies who are unable to show
  findings that reject the null hypothesis languish unnoticed, while the ones
  that do not attract attention.
- An "event" is the thing the probability of is being measured.
- P(A), the probability of event A, is defined as m/n, where A is satisfied by
  exactly m of n outcomes.
- P(E | C) is the probability of event E, given condition C.
- A random (stochastic) process is a process where the outcome is
  probabilistic rather than deterministic.
- A random variable is a variable that depends on a random process,
  e.g. tossing a die is a random process and the number on the top is the value
  of the random variable.
- Bias is systemic if it favors an outcome over another, e.g. telephone surveys
  that miss various types of people, like those who don't want to participate
  (this is a type of sample called a voluntary response sample).
- Extrapolation is a common error where conclusions are drawn from beyond the
  range of data.
- Standard deviation provides no asymmetry information on skewed distributions.
  Many standard statistical techniques are invalid for these.

Another statistics course taken by coworker. Slides in a file called
bayesian_statistics-2011.pdf.

Notes:
- Non-Bayesian statistical methods include method of moments and maximum
  likelihood.
- Basic setup:
  - Two events of interest: A and B.
  - E.g., A is a hypothesis about some phenomenon and B is observed data.
  - We may know P(B|A), which is the probability of the data given different
    parameter values.
  - We want to know P(A|B), which is the probability of the hypothesis being
    true given the data.
- Bayes' Theorem: P(A|B) = (P(B|A)P(A))/P(B).
- IID = independently and identically distributed.  E.g., roulette wheel spins
  are IID.

I think what's still missing here is the digital currency.  If an existing or a

it's probably inevitable (though unlikely in my lifetime).  If implemented, the
global economy would really resemble a healthy macro-organism (at least to the

Like a lot of early philosophical work, this suffers from the lack of language
available to effectively communicate the points.  Some tend to be banal and/or
needlessly expanded upon, but that could also be failings of the author.  In
any case, this particular presentation of it sucks and reads like someone's
book report, though it's by Charles Pierce (himself a renown philosopher and
mathematician).  I've seen enough to know when I'm wasting my time.

This book bears all the signs of being mall-bookstore fodder, but I'll give it
a few hours.  If this guy knows something I don't, then it'll be worth the
time.

Complaints:
- Yet again, the "magic of compound interest" meme rears it's stupid head.
- "You need a lot of money to retire."  A 65 year old woman in here can't
  retire because she "only" has $600k.
- The author thinks the stock market "historically averages a 10% return".
- Too much crap about marketing, sales, and other such boring crap.
- Includes some really dumb advice, like about direct marketing and flipping
  houses. 
- Very repetitive.  For such a short book, this is pretty lame.

There is some good advice in here, like not including cars and houses in net
worth, but the overall plan is a stupid and inefficient one and the end
scenario in mind here is a glut of consumerism.

Pretty good, but didn't learn anything.  There's way too many anecdotes, but
for a financial book, it does contain a lot of facts and, more importantly,
original research.  However, a lot of these facts are considerably outdated.

<span class="org-link">http://www.zpub.com/notes/black-work.html</span>

While I agree with the dislike of having a job and it (at least, with some
people) being a rational goal to eliminate it, this essay is obviously written
by a person with rather muddled thoughts (quoting Foucault is always a dead
give-away), writing to impress more than to inform (or maybe he's just not
smart enough to write any other way).  In any case, I didn't see much of a
factual basis for the argument here and I'm still waiting for innumerable
issues to be addressed by proponents of this philosophy, as I've thought about
it and can't resolve the majority of them.

I'd also quibble with the definitions here.  I'd define work, in the
non-physics sense, as something like "expending energy to produce a desired
output", which I don't have any particular problem with.  If you desire the
output and are willing to expend the energy to get it, then this transfer is
something you want.  What's ultimately counter-productive is employment (for
too many reasons to bother listing here), but even then I'd only say that
applies to some of the people miserable at their jobs, as most are too stupid
to direct their own resources (time, labor, capital) in a way that would result
in any net benefit for them.  In their case, the misery of employment &lt; the
misery of failure to self-direct their life, and they are making the optimal
choice.  Were I to write a treatise on the subject, it would focus entirely
upon identifying the real cost/benefits of the transaction, at least where its
optional (non-optional employment is a different topic).

Finally (though there's many other problems here), I'd argue that for most
humans, they already have too much play time, and that, especially in current
Western consumerist culture, the play time they do engage is destructive, both
to themselves and externally.

Basically, the issue is too multi-faceted to be waved away with a social
commentary.  The closest thing I would declare to being a "root cause" is that
humans are currently, individually and in aggregate, simply too stupid to build
a world much better than what we have.

- Reversing the Northeastern Insurgency: Useful info on the situation in
  Kunduz, Baghlan, and Takhar.
- Haqqani Network in Kurram: Useful info on a major Sunni terrorist target in

- Counterinsurgency in Helmand: At the time of this writing, Helmand was way
  better than a year ago, but still has some serious issues.  Progress has
  continued since then, but it won't be till late summer until we know if it's
  a trend shift.
- Operation Moshtarak - Taking and Holding Marjah: A bit outdated, but this
  battle was the decisive action of the operation on an enemy stronghold.

Reading these definitely helped a lot.  They tend to be a bit positively
focused, but that could be because things are a little better now than a year
ago.  I'll check back here in 6 months to see if any new stuff is posted.

Article by the now deceased founder of Freenode, Bob Levin, on free and open
source software.

Hopelessly na&#239;ve.  Ignores inherent properties of physical resources.  For
example, a population of beings trapped on a single planet have a fixed amount
of land resource.  As the population increases, land becomes increasingly
scarce.  This essay is about copyrights though, but the basis for the argument
is flawed.  Overall, a worthless essay.

Well written at times, boring at others.  Apart from occasionally being
entertained by a witty phrase or two, not much was learned here.  Essays like
these are common on HN, after all, so I've heard it all before.  Much of this
is similar to my perspective on CLIs and technology culture, but I think
Stephenson's techno-epistemology has a few holes in it that mine doesn't.

Regarding the technical content, it's shallow, outdated, and even contains
minor errors (e.g. C++ is not a dialect of C, not all GNU/Linux distros have
similar directory structures, Emacs isn't spelled with a lower case first
letter, etc.).  I might've enjoyed this as a young n00blet, had I not been
already well past that point by the time this was published.

A truly excellent book, among the top of hard scifi novels I've ever read.  An
excellent exploration of sentience, a realistic portrayal of human thought,
good writing, realistic characters, realistic progression of future technology
(minus one point), and one of the better and more interesting ETIs out there.
Not totally perfect, but more than what anyone could expect from a novel.

It's okay, but nothing special.  IMO, a mystery should be solvable by the
reader if he's smart enough.  The final exposition should either confirm or
deny your theory then.  This isn't one of those though.

Pretty good, but too much character development for my tastes.  Much of the
purpose of the novel hinges on how human psychology reacts to the kind of
situations here, and that, at least for me, isn't all that interesting.  Apart
from that, however, it's a good read.

While I'd probably more enjoyed these ideas here presented in non-fiction form,
this is, in a lot of ways, real science fiction should be, as apart from the
plot, it's almost not even fiction at all.  The writing here is often top

(far beyond my writing ability).

Another Poul Anderson (author of Tau Zero) novel.

Too much boring interpersonal relations content (often at the expense of the
scifi content).  Then the scifi content itself is pretty generic and
uninteresting on top of that.  There's also a lot of pointless filler with
side-stories that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot, which itself
meanders aimlessly.  A lot of this is probably due to the way it was originally
published as a collection of short stories over many years, but I've seen that
done well too, so it's no excuse.  A shame, since the scenario here could have
been used for great things.

Attempting to read all of these.
- The Engines of God: First book of The Academy series. Not bad, but has a lot
  of long-winded filler.
- Deepsix: Pretty uncreative.  The alien fauna/flora are all unimaginative
  variants of Earth creature.  Uses a serious physical impossibility of welding
  carbon nanotubes.  The plot line isn't just one long rescue/survival mission
  and not very scifi.
- Chindi: A boring, predictable rescue-adventure with cartoon-like characters.
- Omega: This series is getting more stupid and lazy.
- Odyssey: Skipping this one.
- Cauldron: Same problems as the rest of the series.  The final resolution of
  the main issue across the series is thoroughly disappointing.

This author exhibits a large lack of imagination and seems content with
producing reams of text describing mundane and inconsequential activities.

Installing this on Ubuntu so they can be generated on work power.

Setup:
- sudo apt-add-repository ppa:stretch/bitcoin
- sudo apt-get update
- sudo apt-get install bitcoin
- Run `bitcoin' and limit coin generation to one processor (since I need to get
  work done too).
- Make note of bitcoin address.

Unfortunately, there's only that lame GTK client.  I like the concept of
bitcoin though, so hopefully it'll catch on.  Generating coins takes up too
much CPU to get work done, but if I get a spare machine at work and it's not
doing anything, I'll reinstall the client there.

Update: I've read up on some criticism of bitcoin, and while I don't agree with
all of it, some of it does make sense.  My main concern with it is that it
doesn't directly represent a physical commodity, rather an artificially created
one (which, arguably, isn't a commodity at all).  There's also the problem of
value stored in bitcoin to simply disappear if you were sloppy with backups.
I'm not sure it even can be called money, since it's not a direct store of
value, unlike, say, certificates representing metals, which can be
issued/disappear as the supply of the physical metal increases/decreases.

To properly package up Python software, I'll need these packages.

python-pip: A Package installer.
- Installed on FreeBSD from devel/py-pip.

python-distribute: A replacement for Setuptools.
- Installed via `pip install distribute.

python-nose: A unit test framework for Python.
- Installed on FreeBSD from devel/py-nose.  Next time I'll install via pip
  though.

python-virtualenv: Creates isolated Python environments.
- Installed via `pip install virtualenv'.

Added these to fbsd_setup.org.  Might want to briefly read up more on these
later (particularly nose).  nose is pretty nice, and I'm definitely going to be
using it.  However, in work environments, I might not be able to install
packages, in which case, perhaps doctest unit tests might be best
(<span class="org-link">http://docs.python.org/library/doctest.html</span>).

Considering using this for cloud analytics, as much of that is still a pain on
*BSD, and I'm not even sure if all of it is possible.  In either case, I know
some of the development tools I need don't work.  This will take a bit of
mindless config work to customize it though.

Setup notes:
- Run the ncurses expert install.  Be sure to install the SSH server.
- The rest is pretty standard (basically a subset of my FreeBSD install).  It
  does require an install of some extra stuff though, like finger, postgres,
  etc.
- Find specific versions of packages using `aptitude search &lt;pkg_name&gt;' or
  `apt-cache search '^&lt;pkg_name&gt;'.
- To restart the network, run `sudo ifup -a'.  If network-manager is being
  used, use `sudo /etc/init.d/network-manager restart'.
- Install autocutsel to merge cutbuffer and X selection.  Add to .xinitrc.

Setup complete.  Debian is a lot more n00b than it was the last time I used it
&gt;10 years ago, but it's still better than n00buntu.  Now I just need to get
Hadoop and other cloud stuff installed, but those are in separate tasks.  So
far, it seems all this should work.

Update: Had to redo it since my typical 8GB disk is too small to run a cloud
on.  Need at least 40GB for the datasets I use.

Migrate everything to GitHub.  As superior as Darcs is, it looks like it's
lost (I'm declaring GHC's migration to git to be the day this happened).

Maybe I'll still use Darcs for local development or things I don't publish.

I'm not going to bother trying to migrate all my change history from Darcs.
I'll just dump everything in GitHub as is, and go from there.

Tasks:
- Setup git on home Windows box (all my other machines already have it).  Add
  the git/bin directory to %PATH%.  Alternatively just use the Cygwin version.
- If I want a VCS GUI, setup TortoiseGit.  I'm not a fan though, since it
  doesn't integrate with xplorer2.
- Enter SSH keys into GitHub for all machines and VMs.
- Read the GitHub docs to make sure I'm not doing anything stupid.
- Export my Darcs repo, and start committing to GitHub.  I'll want to
  reorganize everything into projects for grad_school, practice, and then ones
  for everything else.
- Check out the markup syntax for README files.
- Update website repo links.

GitHub config setup:
git config --global user.name "Bruce C. Miller"
git config --global user.email "bm3719@gmail.com"
git config --global github.user bm3719
git config --global github.token f574d0a8e5f3f377e7e2a21e8326249e
git config --global color.ui auto
git config --global core.whitespace trailing-space,space-before-tab
git config --global diff.renames copies
git config --global diff.mnemonicprefix true
git config --global merge.stat true

Workflow example for creating grad_school project:
mkdir grad_school
cd grad_school
git init
touch README
git add README
git commit -m 'first commit'
git remote add origin git@github.com:bm3719/grad_school.git
git push -u origin master

After that's done, I can just do the add, commit -am "comment here", and push.
Decided to just use plain text README files for now.

Google results have way too much garbage in them these days.  I'll start

more useful results.

Conkeror setup notes:
- Added "blekko" and "b" webjump to .conkerorrc.
- Adblock the following URL patterns to get rid of the junk/ads:
  <span class="org-link">http://a.blekko-img.com/*/imgs/promos/*</span>

  <span class="org-link">http://platform.twitter.com/widgets/tweet_button.html*</span>
- Go to prefs and hide stuff I don't want (these are apparently not all stored
  server-side, so it's necessary to do it on every machine).

emacs-w3m setup notes:
- It's not possible to modify the defcustoms of w3m-uri-replace-alist and
  w3m-search-engine-alist in a w3m-mode-hook function, as these aren't declared
  prior to the hook being run.
- Run `cd /usr/local/share/emacs/23.1/site-lisp/w3m; sudo chmod u+w w3m.el
  w3m-search.el'.
- Add `("\\`bb:" w3m-search-uri-replace "blekko")' to w3m-uri-replace-alist in
  w3m.el,
- Add `("blekko" "<span class="org-link">http://blekko.com/ws/%s"</span>)' to w3m-search-engine-alist in
  w3m-search.el.
- Run `sudo rm w3m.elc w3m-search.elc'.
- Run `sudo emacs -Q -batch -f batch-byte-compile w3m.el w3m-search.el'.
- Restart w3m or Emacs

I'll still use Gmail and some of the other Google services, but they've dropped
the ball on search, IMO (too much spam and too many content farms).  One thing
Blekko does suck at is having their homepage usable in text mode (hence the
need for the custom w3m setup).

I might use this on days off for day trading and occasionally in the
evening/morning for extended hours trading.

Made a layout.  The UI sucks pretty bad though and it's obviously using some
older toolkit.  I'll switch to Interactive Brokers (my preferred by far) or
Tradestation after I retire.  In the meantime, I might activate the Level II
window, since I do more than 7 trades per month, but only after I'm sure I'll
be trading a lot regularly (I suspect I'll get hit with a fee as soon as I have
a month with a low number of trades).

Notes:
- Use +SYM in a chart window to add a symbol to an existing chart.
- Use (SYM) in a chart window to add a symbol in its own plot to an existing
  chart.
- Hold down left click to get the bar information window up on a chart without
  having it up all the time (which gets annoying).
- Must disable extended hours in order to chart back more than 10 weeks.

Pylint tutorial: <span class="org-link">http://www.logilab.org/card/pylint_tutorial</span>

Notes:
- Typically, I'll want to run with `--reports=n --include-ids=y'.  The former
  usually generates a lot of scroll I don't need and the latter gives me the
  IDs of the warning, so I can look it up.
- If a warning isn't obvious, run `pylint --help-msg=&lt;ID&gt;'.

I was going to create a custom config file, but I'm okay with the defaults

See if I want to define this.  I only know about the 512B block sizes used in
df and du, but I'm sure there's other effects.  As a FreeBSD-user, I'm not a
POSIX fundamentalist, but I appreciate at least partial compliance.  However,
this environmental parameter might flag behavior I don't want.

du/df: No effect for me, since I always use -k or -m explicitly.
tar: Seems to me to make more sense to stick with GNU tar standards.
patch/getopt: Was unable to locate any reference to this in the C source,
though supposedly it affects it.

As I can't really find any significant references to it in the FreeBSD GNU
source besides the stuff I don't care about, I'll skip this.

Made a task for reading the full POSIX standard.  Might be worth an attempt.

ORM frameworks used to be simple enough to figure out without any dedicated
studying, but as much as I'd like to attempt to get through life without it,
Hibernate is just too all-pervasive in the Java ecology to remain ignorant of
and too feature-bloated to leave to learning by osmosis (at least by my
standards).  I am, however, making a directed effort here to only learn the
basics and will revisit the subject again later if I notice too much weakness
in practice.

Tasks:
- Read Wikipedia page on ORM:
  <span class="org-link">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping</span>
- Read Wikipedia page on Hibernate:
  <span class="org-link">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibernate_</span>(Java)
- Read the official Getting Started Guide:
  <span class="org-link">http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/core/3.6/quickstart/en-US/html_single/</span>
- Check out the Hibernate tutorial projects linked in the above guide under
  the Preface.
- Read the book Harnessing Hibernate.
- Read the book Hibernate Recipes: A Problem-Solution Approach.
- Read some of the PDF version of Hibernate Core Reference Manual and keep it
  around for a reference.  This is the same documentation installed into
  Eclipse and available in the distribution tarball.
- Write at least one decent sample application against a MySQL database.  Maybe
  use this example, modifying it slightly:
  <span class="org-link">http://www.mkyong.com/hibernate/quick-start-maven-hibernate-mysql-example/</span>
- Find some documentation on Hibernate Eclipse integration or read a few
  tutorials on it online.
- Maybe watch some of these videos: <span class="org-link">http://docs.jboss.org/tools/movies/</span>

Setup Notes:
- Install JBoss Tools Hibernate plugin on Eclipse.  See task "Eclipse
  customization" for some details on this.
- For a manual Hibernate install (which normally shouldn't be necessary, since
  I'll pull it in via Maven), grab a zip or tarball from:
  <span class="org-link">http://sourceforge.net/projects/hibernate/files/hibernate3/</span>
- Don't even bother trying to use the distribution version of Hibernate -- too
  many dependencies to manually manage.

Notes (Getting Started Guide and sample projects):
- See ~/src/java/hibernate_tutorial for my version of this code.  This includes
  modifications to the original master POM to get it to build.
- The tutorial projects don't work out of the box due to JBoss moving their
  repos all over the place.  Add at least this repo to the POM:
  <span class="org-link">http://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public-jboss</span>
- The tutorial also requires specifying the JDK version in a plugin block for
  maven-compiler-plugin.

Notes (Quick start Maven + Hibernate + MySQL Example):
- Ran `mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.macroexpand.hbtest
  -DartifactId=hbtest -DpackageName=com.macroexpand.hbtest
  -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -DinteractiveMode=false
  -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.maven.archetypes
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart' in ~/src/java.
- Created a src/main/resources directory and added hbtest.sql, with code from:
  <span class="org-link">http://www.mkyong.com/mysql/preparing-mysql-data-for-tutorial/</span>  This will
  also include the Hibernate XML files.
- Ran `source ~/src/java/hbtest/src/main/resources/hbtest.sql' in MySQL.
- Ran `mvn eclipse:eclipse' in ~/src/java/hbtest to generate an Eclipse
  project.

General notes:
- If creating a DAO object that you want to persist, and it has a sequence for
  a primary key, the generator tag within the id tag (with a default of
  "assigned") can be set to "increment" to not require the primary key to be
  defined in code.  If you want to actually call the sequence.nextval, then
  "sequence" works.  There's also "uuid" and several others.

To generate DAO classes:
- Enter Hibernate perspective.
- Create a new configuration with the desired database.  For Oracle 10g, add
  the Oracle 10g thin client and select the ojdbc14.jar deep within Oracle's
  install directory.  Set the hibernate.dialect in the main configuration to
  match the database type.  Test it by expanding all the databases in the
  Hibernate Configurations view.
- Go to Run|Hibernate Code Generation.  Create a new configuration here.  Set
  the console configuration to the previously created one.  Set the output
  directory to &lt;project_dir&gt;/src/main/java.  Have a hibernate.reveng.xml file
  ready with the tables desired to persist.  Select "Reverse engineer from JDBC
  Connection", set the package to where the new classes should go, and point to
  the reveng.xml file.  In Exporters, select "Domain code" and "DAO code".
- Save and run.  Move around the files as desired, insert the annotations
  necessary, and rewrite the session management code.

I still don't feel super confident using Hibernate.  Part of the early
frustration was mostly due to not realizing that the code generator output
almost always needs to be rewritten.  Hibernate sucks less than Spring, but
it's still a painful framework to work in.  I can see it being easy once you
internalize all the magic keywords, but I'm still not convinced that it
actually saves time overall.  I didn't complete all the tasks here, but I don't
think it was necessary mainly because I'm now not going to be using it much
(and hopefully not at all), but also because any further features I need to use
will just be the same painful process of digging through docs and message board
posts.  I may pick up some of these tasks later if I ever have to work in it
again.

Already sorta know Python, and have been using it lightly for awhile now.  But
since it's now a work language for me, I need to refresh what I already know,
and fill in the basics that I don't.

Tasks:
- Read/do "Learn Python the Hard Way".
- Read some of "Python: The Essential Reference".
- Maybe do the practice problems from:
  <span class="org-link">http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english2e/</span>
- Use <span class="org-link">http://docs.python.org/library/index.html</span> (and the other documentation
  there) regularly while writing code.

By the end here I should be pretty comfortable with full scale Python project
programming.  Python isn't a hard language or anything, so I'm not going to
really do any super-dedicated studying.

I'm not a big fan of Python's OOP model.  There's a lot of crufty design here.
The syntax is also a bit awkward.  It's nothing terrible, and easy to get used
to, but for being one of the supposedly great new dynamic languages, it's
sloppy.

Decided to skip the 3rd book since the returns on that would be minor.  It
looks like some good practice though, so I may do it anyway later.

Install this, create a sample database, and maybe write a script or two.  I'll
give the manual (available on the project site) a skim.  I've used PostgreSQL
before plenty and using it is no more difficult than MySQL, so this is mainly
just to make sure I can set it up and admin the database.

Reading parts of the PostgreSQL 8.4 manual, online at: 
<span class="org-link">http://www.postgresql.org/files/documentation/pdf/8.4/postgresql-8.4.6-US.pdf</span>

Setup notes:
- Installed PostgreSQL 8.4 on Debian.  I may also want postgresql-doc-8.4 and
  pgadmin3.  If I install pgAdmin, I'll definitely want postgresql-contrib-8.4.
- `sudo -u postgres psql' to log into the database.  This won't require a
  password at fresh install.
- Set a password for the postgres role with:
  ALTER ROLE postgres WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'mypassword';
- To enable some pgAdmin functions, run `sudo -u postgres psql -d postgres &lt;
  /usr/share/postgresql/8.4/contrib/adminpack.sql'.
- To enable remote access, edit /etc/postgresql/8.4/main/postgresql.conf with
  listen_addresses = '*', then edit /etc/postgresql/8.4/main/pg_hba.conf,
  adding the line `host all all 192.168.1.0/24 md5' (this is for the 192.168.1
  subnet -- change to whatever makes sense).
- Address ident authentication issues by editing
  /etc/postgresql/8.4/main/pg_ident.conf.  This maps system users to DB users.
  Or, more easily, just edit pg_hba.conf, comment out ident lines, and add
  `local all postgres trust' and maybe `host all all 127.0.0.1/32 trust'.
- Restart PostgreSQL with `/etc/init.d/postgresql restart'.
- Now I should be able to connect with pgAdmin and/or create databases and
  login with psql as my normal user.
- For example, create a database with `createdb -U postgres bmdb', then log
  into it with `psql bmdb postgres'.
- If I want to be able to run PostgreSQL commands and log into psql without
  specifying a user, I can just add a PostgreSQL user of the same name as my OS
  user.  Alternatively, I could set $PGUSER to whichever login I want.

Notes:
- The built-in point type is a coordinate pair, which could be useful for
  geo-data.
- Insta-load data from text files using COPY, e.g. `COPY weather FROM
  '/path/to/somefile.txt';'.
- Use INHERITS clauses in CREATE TABLE statements to create a table that has
  all of the parent's columns, plus some additional ones.

pgAdmin sucks pretty bad, but it gets the job done most of the time.  I'll
probably try to stick to the command line as usual.

Of the PostgreSQL manual, read the sections I and II.  A painfully boring read,
but this manual will be good to keep around for reference.

Ugh, Spring...  Hopefully I can position myself in my remaining work years to
minimize or exclude this from my day.

Read:
- The Wikipedia page on Spring: <span class="org-link">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_framework</span>
- This introduction:
  <span class="org-link">http://www.theserverside.com/news/1364527/Introduction-to-the-Spring-Framework</span>
- The majority of Spring Framework 2.5 Reference Manual: 
  <span class="org-link">http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/index.html</span>
- The book Spring Recipes: A Problem-Solution Approach (2nd Ed.).
- The What's New chapter of the Spring Framework 3.0 Reference Manual:
  <span class="org-link">http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/</span>
- Consider reading Spring Enterprise Recipes if I feel still a bit lacking
  after the above.

PDFs of the Reference Manuals are also available at:
<span class="org-link">http://www.springsource.org/documentation</span>

I seem to have managed to sufficiently alter my work such that Spring is no
longer necessary, at least for now.  I did do some of the sub-tasks here, but
it's unlikely I'll retain anything in a few months, so I'm calling this
canceled.  It's entirely possible that Spring could force its ugly presence
upon me again in the future, at which point I'll reopen this.

Hive is a "data warehouse infrastructure built on top of Hadoop".  Data is
stored in HDFS (with all the benefits that entails) and ad-hoc querying is
provided using HiveQL (an SQL-like language).  Queries are translated into
MapReduce jobs.  These can be slow (depending on the cloud and data), thus it's
not suitable for real-time querying, nor does Hive provide the majority of
RDBMS features (even basic ones, like foreign keys).  However, it is a useful
method for storing and interfacing with data on Hadoop, as it abstracts a lot
of the lower-end programming necessary when writing MapReduce code and
simplifies data management.

Tasks:
- Grab the source and read the README.txt.
- Read everything on the Hive wiki (starting at
  <span class="org-link">http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Hive/GettingStarted</span>).
- Find some extra info on UDFs/UDAFs.
- Watch the Hive videos linked on the Getting Started page.
- Read all of the example queries to make sure I didn't miss any important
  syntax.
- Read the entire Hive commits, user, and dev mailing lists archives
  (pre-Hadoop sub project).  Only reading stuff that is relevant to Hive
  architecture or HiveQL.
- Might read some of the source code.

Setup:
- Either run `git clone <span class="org-link">https://github.com/apache/hive.git'</span> or `svn co
  <span class="org-link">http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hive/trunk</span> hive' (at least, for trunk).
- `cd hive_trunk', then `ant clean package'.  This takes forever, since ivy has
  to grab a ton of dependencies.
- build/dist in now ready to deploy somewhere.  
- Instead of the above, just grab the binary distribution and upack it
  somewhere.
- Set $HIVE_HOME to wherever I deploy Hive and add $HIVE_HOME/bin to $PATH.
- Make sure Hadoop is already properly installed and working (and that
  $HADOOP_HOME points to the right place with $HADOOP_HOME/bin in $PATH).
- Run these commands to create the expected Hive HDFS directory structure:
  - hadoop fs -mkdir /tmp
  - hadoop fs -mkdir /user/hive/warehouse
  - hadoop fs -chmod g+w /tmp
  - hadoop fs -chmod g+w /user/hive/warehouse
- Edit $HIVE_HOME/conf/hive-site.xml (compare these to the defaults in
  conf/hive-defaults.xml).
- Add any user-specific Hive startup options in $HIVE_OPTS (added "-hiveconf
  hive.root.logger=ERROR,console" for my setup).
- I had problems compiling Hive from source, and just grabbed the binary
  distribution.  However, my problems were network-related, so I may retry
  later.
- Modified .emacs to include:
  ;; Add an auto-mode for the typical HiveQL extension.
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.hql$" . sql-mode))

General notes:
- HiveQL-specific notes in test_ddl.hql, test_dml.hql, test_q.hql, and
  test_full.hql.
- See the two sets of CLI flags with `hive -h' and `hive --help'.
- Use SET to set various Hadoop configuration variables.  Use `SET -v;' to list
  all variables/settings.  Just `SET;' will list the non-default variables.
- For processing a job locally, which can be quicker for a very small dataset,
  use `SET mapred.job.tracker=local;' (only works in &gt;0.7).  This uses space in
  mapred.local.dir.  It's also possible to enable this to automatically use
  local mode for small data (&lt;128MB, &lt;4 map tasks, &lt;2 reduce tasks by default)
  with `SET hive.exec.mode.local.auto=true;'.  These are disabled by default.
- Logging: Can configure the logger for the session with hive.root.logger,
  e.g. `-hiveconf hive.root.logger=INFO,console'.  This is an exception to the
  ability to set a variable with SET (since it's initialized at start).  Errors
  by default go to /tmp/&lt;user&gt;/hive.log (on the local FS).
- Java regexes work on some commands like `show tables '&lt;regex_string&gt;''.  See:
  <span class="org-link">http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html</span>
- Due to the use of Derby, only one connection can access Hive (either through
  the CLI or through HQL scripts).  A connection creates lock files in
  $HIVE_HOME/metastore_db.  One way around this currently is
  HiveDerbyServerMode.
- Lots of HiveQL examples in build/dist/examples/queries and more in the source
  at ql/src/test/queries/positive.
- `hive -f' doesn't like dangling comment blocks (comment blocks without any
  code under it).
- If using Hive to run Python scripts, use sys.path.append(os.getcwd()).
- In the USING..AS clauses (where you can put a Python script), pretty much
  anything that writes to stdout can be here (e.g. /bin/cat).
- Hive now supports WHERE..IN.  Prior to that, it required `find_in_set(col1,
  'abc,xyz') &lt;&gt; 0', with coalesce() if the column has NULL values.
- Full list of Hive types: <span class="org-link">http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Hive/HiveQL/Types</span>
- To use external variables, e.g. `describe ${hiveconf:var}' in a file called
  t.hql, run the script with `hive -hiveconf var=mytable -f t.hql.
- Date types aren't yet supported.  Must use strings instead for now.
- See the EXPLAIN plan for any query with `EXPLAIN [EXTENDED] &lt;query&gt;'.
- The name node will be in safe mode 30 seconds after startup.  Turn this off
  manually with `hadoop dfsadmin -safemode leave' or just wait.
- Use `insert overwrite local 'local_directory' select ...' to dump stuff to
  local files.  This output will have control characters in it, so I usually
  insert commas in the select and then filter out the \x01 chars with a Python
  script that does a `re.sub(r"[^a-z0-9-';.,]", "", line)'.

UDFs (user defined functions):
- Get a description of functions with `describe function &lt;function_name&gt;;'.
  `describe function extended &lt;function_name&gt;' for full details.
- There's some weird rules with HiveQL UDF/UDAF use.  Keep this reference for
  work-arounds: <span class="org-link">http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Hive/LanguageManual/UDF</span>
- Start Hive with `--auxpath /path/to/file.jar' to add jars to the classpath.
  An alternative is to define $HIVE_AUX_JARS_PATH (comma delimited).  This is
  useful for packaging UDFs for use within Hive.  If doing this, it's then
  necessary to do `create temporary function &lt;func_name&gt; as
  'com.company.pkg_name.ClassName';'.
- To call a UDF by itself, do something like `select to_date('1900-01-01') from
  &lt;some_small_table&gt; limit 1;'.  Ideally, some_small_table would just have one
  row and it might make sense to create a dummy table.
- UDFs can be written in Java or Python (and other languages).
- A UDAF is an aggregate function, for which there are special considerations
  for (due to MapReduce).  A UDTF is a table-generating function.

I'm now able to be productive with Hive.  Read some of the mailing list but it
seemed like a non-optimal use of time, as was reading the source.  The rest of
the expertise will come with using it all the time.  I'll still read the Hive
wiki and mailing list occasionally when I have some free time though.

Need to know this in great detail.  I'll call this done when I'm familiar with
most of the common settings, know how to load stuff into HDFS, have
internalized the HDFS basic commands, understand Hadoop internals to some
extent, and have a list of online resources to consult when I need detailed
info.

Hadoop involves two components: HDFS and MapReduce.  My approach is:
- Survey the Hadoop ecology, learning the problem space it addresses and how it
  fits in with other cloud computing technologies.
- Read up in detail on HDFS.
- Install Hadoop on a virtual cluster.
- Read up in detail on MapReduce.
- Find the Java APIs to program against Hadoop.
- If I have time, write some practice code.

Tasks:
- Attended a work class on this topic.  This was pretty good for an overview.
- Reread the class slides later.
- Watched a few videos online about various Hadoop stuff and Google's
  MapReduce.  There's a pretty good Google Code video series called "Cluster
  Computing and MapReduce".
- Read the Hadoop wiki overview.
- Read this Hadoop Tutorial: <span class="org-link">http://developer.yahoo.com/hadoop/tutorial/</span>
- Read the book "Hadoop: The Definitive Guide".
- Read the MapReduce tutorial:
  <span class="org-link">http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/r0.18.3/mapred_tutorial.html</span>

It turns out I'm not currently directly writing any Java code against
MapReduce/HDFS (only Hive and Hadoop streaming in Python), so I'll skip
mastering that for now and come back later and finish it.  I'll also defer
setting up my own psuedo-distributed cluster (at work, admin is handled
externally).

Weka is a suite of machine learning algorithms.  I've used this back in grad
school, but that was a long time ago.

<span class="org-link">http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/index_documentation.html</span>

Tasks:
- Read Wikipedia page on Weka:
  <span class="org-link">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weka_</span>(machine_learning)
- Read Weka Manual 3.7.3.
- Review all of the algorithms used by Weka.

Setup:
- Just installed binary version via apt-get on GNU/Linux.
- Ensure that weka.jar is in $CLASSPATH.

Notes:
- See book notes under Weka Manual entry.
- Generally, it's much easier to just use the Weka GUI to select parameters and
  such, but running `java weka.&lt;package.class&gt;' is pretty good about showing
  them too.  Flag input files with -t.
- I see many possibilities using Weka for writing trading bots.
- Kappa statistic (Cohen's kappa coefficient): A statistical measure of
  inter-rater agreement.  1.0 signifies complete agreement.
- A history of algorithms and flags used gets written to weka.log.

Couldn't find a list of all of Weka's algorithms with descriptions.  I might
make one of these myself later, but that's a lot more work.

I already know a lot about this, but now that it's my job, I'll add some more
focus on it to fill in the gaps.  Skipping the Soviet-Afghan war background as
I already know that in great detail.

Tasks:
- Update on unclass recent war history.  Using The Institute for the Study of
  War papers from the last year, mainly.
- Read: <span class="org-link">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Islamic_period_of_Afghanistan</span>
- Read: <span class="org-link">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_conquest_of_Afghanistan</span>

  <span class="org-link">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shi'a&#8211;Sunni_relations</span>
- Read:
  <span class="org-link">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war_in_Afghanistan_%281996%E2%80%932001%29</span>
- Read up on the Taliban and various factions.
- Read up on the various other groups: IMU, LeT, etc.
- Afghanistan geography.  Maybe grab a provincial map and keep filling it in
  until I can do it by memory.  At least become familiar with FATA provinces.
  <span class="org-link">http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/afghanistan/images/afghan-provinces-map.gif</span>

Notes:
- Historic Bactria, supposed birthplace of Zoroaster, was the origin of the
  Kushan empire and now the modern day Balkh province.
- The main differences between Shia and Sunni: Shiites believe only the 4th
  caliph, Ali, and his heirs are the rightful successors of Mohammad, whereas
  Sunnis believe Abu Bakar (and 3 others, including Ali) held that position.
  Also, Shiites believe the Mahdi is here and in hiding, whereas Sunnis believe
  he hasn't come yet.  In addition to these, there are numerous small cultural
  differences and which hadiths (narratives) are accepted.
- The Taliban are anti-Shia and primarily Pashtun.
- The primary Taliban division is between TTP (Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan) and
  Afghan Taliban.  The primary difference is the theater (FATA
  vs. Afghanistan).  Both factions are enemies of Iran (for the most part), and
  TTP is currently in open conflict with the Pakistani regular army.
- IMU seems like not a significant entity on its own, though its tight ties
  with the Taliban bolster its fighting strength a little.  LeT is primarily
  anti-India, and not a huge player in the Afghanistan war.

Decided to skip the province memorizing for now.  After all this reading, I
know where most of the important ones are and recognize their names, which
should be enough.  I'll try to read at least a paper about the war every few
weeks to keep up on the latest.

ZooKeeper is a service and library for building distributed data structures.  A
number of idioms exist for this, and ZooKeeper implements these for you.  After
reading the chapter on it in Hadoop: The Definitive Guide, reading the intro
pages on the ZooKeeper wiki, and reading some Cloudera blog posts, I still am
not completely sure how it integrates with Hadoop, or even if it does, but
since I'm not using it at work, I'm capping my effort here.

An okay time-waster.  Not much thinking involved though.  It's possible for a

that solution not be the one the game determines to be a correct answer.  I

IMO, better than Fallout 3 overall and a great game, but still has some
problems.  This game captures the original Fallout feel better than 3 (not that
I'm particularly hung up on that), has vastly improved weapons, and is just a
more interesting world to interact with.

Complaints:
- The true-to-the-series, massive collection of bugs everywhere.  Even with the
  patch, any play-through encounters a ton of game freezes, quest system bugs,
  stuck NPCs, etc, forcing reloads and restarts.
- Numerous graphical issues like with draw distance and model clipping.
- Not many of the NPCs really had all that much character.  The previous
  Fallout games weren't that great at this either, but 3 did it slightly
  better.
- Many areas have almost nothing to do, as if they were just slapped together.
- Less game real estate than 3, which itself was a bit lacking for my tastes.
  Particularly in the western desert setting, stuff should have been way more
  spread out.  Both Bethesda games squish real life geography all close
  together.  Boulder, CO is over 700 miles from Las Vegas, NV, for example, not
  the approximate 1 mile it seems to be in the game.
- Other annoying geographical errors.  The desert around Las Vegas is very
  flat, not surrounded by mountains.  Like with the distances, the cities, Lake
  Mead, Nellis, etc. are all an astronomically small fraction of what they are
  in real life.
- Way too many houses/buildings are boarded off.  This is just lazy,
  particularly since they already had all the previous game's models to use.
  All they'd have had to do is map edit them up.
- No really decent housing (that I found so far).  I ended up moving into the
  gas station at Goodsprings since it was far superior of a location than the
  other bases I got.  The Lucky 38's upgrade menu was also bugged and unusable.
- Only 3 casino games (+1 custom game)?  At least craps should have been
  added.  The way it is now, casinos get old pretty fast.  The games that were
  included were done well, however.
- It's not humanly possible to reload a single action revolver that fast (same
  goes for a lot of the other guns).
- The ending is kinda bleh.

May play again some day in power-game mode.

Played this a lot back in the mid-90s, but never beat it thanks to the
timebombs on the orbital station.  I'll also try the Church campaign.

Setup:
- Grab the Syndicate Wars DOSBox config from:
  <span class="org-link">http://syndicate.lubie.org/downloads/swars/swars_dosbox_6_5_conf.zip</span>
- Install DOSBox if it isn't already, and create a shortcut to DOSBox.exe.  Put
  the .conf file in the DOSBox install directory.  Add `-conf
  dosboxSyndWars.conf' to the target line.
- Create an install dir and start DOSBox using the shortcut and run `mount c
  c:\bin\games\swars\'.
- Put the install CD in and run `mount d e:\ -t cdrom -usecd 0'.
- Go to the D: drive and run install.
- Set both sound and music drivers to SB16 and configure automatically.  The
  tests should work.
- Do a full install.
- Edit the play.bat file to include the line `mount d e:\ -t cdrom -usecd 0'
  first.
- Edit the shortcut target to include `c:\bin\games\swars\swars\play.bat'.
- Before playing, at least change the resolution to 640x480, activate deep
  radar, and remap the camera to WASD, zoom to TG, and group agents to Q.
- Set cycles to around 70000.
- Tried the native port as well, but it runs too fast.
- Can't beat the last 3 missions (you have to do them all in a row without
  losing anyone).  I'm sure it's doable, but I don't feel like doing it over
  and over.  Backing up the saved game, and might try again one day when I
  don't have a job.

Great game, even now.  Supposedly a sequel is finally in the works, so will
keep an eye out for that.

Note that the serials I had from before don't work.  First ensure the directory
isn't read only, then use "E4TP99BW".  If it's still being ghey, delete the
GlobalSettings value in the STARS.INI file created in the C:\Windows directory,
then restart and re-enter the serial.  This is also a 16-bit game, so it
doesn't run on 64-bit versions of Windows.  Playing it on an XP VM.  There's an
active channel for the game on Freenode that was helpful for a few things too.

Played a few scenarios.  Definitely a great game and I'll keep it around to
play occasionally.  There's a couple things I'd change, but overall it's just
as good or better than most modern 4x games.  My main complaints are just the
amount of mouse clicking involved despite some advanced automation and the fact
that once the screen gets really full of stuff, it's hard to tell what's going
on without a lot of clicking or digging through report screens.

against another player or the computer.  The actual game content itself is

I'm not going to build a full collection and will only own 3 handguns, each
which serves a distinct purpose:
- Sig Sauer p228: Shoots a cheap, reasonably-effective anti-personnel round.  I
  can effectively engage multiple targets at ranges up to 50+ yards with this.
  I'm only firing this just enough to remain competent with it, as I find
  semi-autos predictably boring to use (especially at ranges).  Accessories: 3
  magazines, an OWB holster, 500rds FMJ, and 50rds JHP.
- Ruger New Model Single Six with 4 5/8" barrel: Target and utility gun.
  Solidly-built enough to last the rest of my life.  Shoots just about any .22
  ammo available.  Post-retirement, this will be handy for shooting squirrels,
  rabbits, and other animals that eat food intended for me (though a rifle
  would be better for this).  The extra .22 magnum cylinder enables it to take
  out medium-sized targets if necessary.  Being a .22, it's main purpose is for
  practicing cheap.  I'll be putting many thousands of rounds through this
  thing, which is why this model was selected and why it was bought new.
  Accessories: western-style holster with belt, 5000rds LRN, 100rds HP, 50rds
  shotshell, and 50rds JHP .22 magnum.
- Colt Detective Special: Concealed carry revolver.  This one was selected
  since the Colt D-frame is roughly between the S&amp;W J- and K-frame, and holds 6
  rounds instead of the J-frame's 5.  Colt DA revolvers also tend to increase
  in value faster than inflation, which is a nice plus, though I intend to keep
  mine forever.  Accessories: IWB holster, 300rds FMJ/LRN, and 50rds JHP.

Finished buying all of these and most of the accessories.  No rifle means no
long range capability, and I'll add one when/if I get a retirement property.  I
wouldn't want to get something now that I can't use later.  I got most of the
accessories, but not all of the ammo, which I'll get later since that much
would weigh a lot.

Update 2012-05-20: Sold the SIG P228 for $500 to a guy I met in Afghanistan.  I
may replace that with a 1911, but I don't really feel unarmed with just the
revolver.  I noticed I don't like firearms as much as I used to when a kid, so
maybe this is fine.

Update 2012-09-24: Bought a Colt Series 80 Government Model.  It's pretty nice.

Update 2012-11-05: Though I wasn't in the market for it, I found a good deal on
an FN SCAR 16s from a desperate seller.  It's definitely a nice rifle.

Apparently it's possible to even do $1/day food, but that'd be tough in my area
with food prices so insanely high and with no ability to grow any significant
quantity of food myself.  I've already been trying to reduce these costs and am
currently at $5.28/day.  If I can manage this, it'll save over $800/yr.

Some methods:
- Eat as much food at work as possible, except candies and donuts (since that
  conflicts with my other goals).
- Buy tons of tomato soup cans whenever they're under $1/each (preferably
  between 50 and 75 cents).
- Buy large bags of potatoes of size 10lbs or more.  10lbs should cost $5 at
  most.  Buy large bags of rice of at least 25lbs.
- Make salads from various combinations of: cucumbers, green peppers, lettuce,
  carrots, radishes, and onions.  Use vinegar, oil, black pepper, and oregano
  instead of normal salad dressing.  I can skip the lettuce to save some money
  though, since it doesn't really provide anything I need to live off of.
- Make sandwiches from $1/loaf bread and tomato, jalepe&#241;os, and mustard.  Get
  some plastic container to bring these to work.
- Buy the cheapest tortillas and make vegetable burritos out of them.  Cans of
  refried beans that are under $1 are also good in combination with these.
- Buy the cheapest, largest box of spaghetti.  Make sauce with tomato paste,
  water, and various spices.
- Whenever I have some random leftover vegetables, combine them with tofu and
  make some stir-fry.  Never eat more than half the block myself though (save
  the rest if there's no one else available to eat it).
- At least eat some non-grain products every day.  Saving all this money won't
  pay off if I end up all sickly and malnourished.  However, pre-modern day
  humans attained the majority of their sustenance from grain (several times
  the percentage of today), and I'm okay with doing the same.

Like other stuff here, this change is permanent (unless I find myself
overwhelmed with piles of cash at some point in the distant future).  If I ever
want a nice meal or to eat out, I'll need to reduce the money expended on other
days to compensate for it.

Successfully implemented this, at least for food.  Miscellaneous supplies like
bathroom products are still adding a bit to my expenses though.  However, I've
discovered I can purchase most of these at the dollar store and reduce their
cost to around $10-15/mo.  I should probably just do a full monthly budget
instead of attacking each expense by itself though.

As much as I hate doing this, it's a smart thing to do for these reasons:
- Food prices keep going up.  I've seen up to a 33% rise in some items I
  regularly buy just in the last 3 years.  For the really expensive things, I'm
  just going to stop eating them.  Even many fresh produce prices are painful
  now.  Just raising a few plants in buckets, if successful, will easily put
  another hundred dollars or more right in my pocket every year.
- Having a garden that takes care of a good portion of my food needs is an
  integral part of my retirement plan.  I need to start developing those skills
  as soon as possible.
- A lot of fresh produce is waxed and not available otherwise.
- I know from eating relatives' garden vegetables that they taste considerably
  better, as they weren't picked unripe.
- More money saved = earlier retirement.

The plan is to spend as little as possible.  So far, I only bought one garden
trowel for $3 and one pack of tomato seeds off Amazon for $1.60.  The
containers are spare cat litter buckets and drink containers cut to size.  The
potting soil I'm stealing from around the neighborhood.  The rest of the seeds
are from vegetables I was eating anyway.

Potentially good balcony plants to try: garlic, tomatoes, green peppers,
jalepe&#241;o peppers, cayenne peppers, radishes, scallions.

Results: Cat grass is easy to grow, but doesn't really save any money.  It does
keep cats from eating my other plants though.  In the winter I planted 1
garlic, 2 tomatoes, 2 green peppers, and 5 radishes.  Most of these died due to
cat eating.  Only the garlic worked out okay.  It turns out I don't have enough
sunlight to grow most plants, especially indoors.  I'll stick to garlic and
radishes until I move.  Thus, I'm not really saving much money, but I did learn
a few things.  However, I can produce some food and it'll save a few
dollars/month which is better than nothing.

All other major tasks take a backseat to learning everything needed to perform
work with minimal effort when starting a new job.  The goal here isn't to
attain complete mastery, as I can pick that up as I go along without much
effort.  This entry is to keep track of overall progress towards this goal --
see individual topic entries for details.

Topics:
- base JavaScript language
- Tomcat
- Ext JS
- base Java language refresh
- survey intelligence analysis
- ActiveMQ
- Maven
- super-brief Nexus survey
- REST services
- Hibernate
- statistics
- statistical learning models
- Spring
- R
- JUnit

Optional topics:
- Jackson
- Hudson
- Mockito

Almost finished this, but since I'm moving to a different project, I'm going to
start a new macro-goal with all of those things.  I do still want to learn R
and statistics in particular a bit better, but that can wait.  For about a year
of self-directed learning, this went pretty good.

Moving to a DARPA project, so I'll need to learn an mostly entirely different
set of work-related technologies.  This could last up to two years, so even if
I spend half of that time getting really good with this stuff, it will be time
well spent.  Most of these things are cloud analytics-related.

Topics:
- Python
- PostgreSQL
- Apache Hadoop (HDFS and MapReduce)
- Apache Hive
- Weka
- HBase
- Tableau
- Apache ZooKeeper
- Mahout
- RapidMiner

Ancillary tasks:
- Setup a work Debian VM.
- NSA CloudBase
- Finish learning R.
- Finish learning statistical learning models.
- Finish learning statistics.

After this, there's a list of related technologies that aren't actively used at
work, but would be useful to at least know in outline (for technology selection
purposes and larger context).  These are listed in the Work-related Topics
section.

Still need to do more math self-learning and there plenty of ancillary stuff to
learn, but I've got all the main topics down now.

Observations for 2011:
- Work life was divided into working on RTRG for a few months, changing jobs to
  DARPA, then deploying to Afghanistan.  Once the last phase began, work and
  normal life merged.
- Net worth more than doubled (multiplied by 2.23).  I'm well ahead of schedule
  on getting my target amount for retirement (by about 1.5 years).  More
  importantly, I've secured a position that reimburses me at a rate where I'll
  hit that amount around mid 2012.
- Successfully made a ton of money in an overall flat market for the year.
- Further optimized possessions for an estimated net reduction of around 20%
  (by weight).
- Optimized several aspects of consumption, which is pretty close to minimal
  now.  There's are a few things to fix here remaining, but none that I can act
  on in the current situation since I live out of a suitcase in random places.
- Mastered Python and further developed several other work-related knowledge
  bases: cloud computing, statistics, algorithms, and functional programming.
- Developed a passable public speaking ability.  Though I'm still no master at
  this, I can now deliver a speech or brief to a full room.  As I suspected,
  this was just a matter of practicing it.
- Learned how to survive (so far) in Afghanistan and among the military.
- Overall, this year was about maximizing net worth, which was the intended
  primary goal.  I did manage to develop some permanently useful skills on top
  of that (and some that will be useless later).  In my opinion, this vastly
  tops the productivity of last year and all major decisions made were the
  right ones.  The trade-off has been that life thoroughly sucks now, but
  that's only temporary.

Major goals for next year:
- Finish acquiring retirement target amount.
- Take a huge amount of time off once I get back from Afghanistan.  By then,
  I'll have gone 1.5 years without a single day off, and will need that time to
  flush some garbage out of the brain.  All warzone-specific knowledge can be
  safely deprecated at that time.  Also use this time to rebuild normal life.
- Do whatever is necessary to be able to stay in Afghanistan until the end of
  November, 2012 to save money on taxes.  If this doesn't work out, it won't be
  a disaster, but I do absolutely need to stay in country until August.  Suffer
  whatever pain comes in the meantime (and there's sure to be a lot of it).
- Maybe come up with a detailed exit plan from work.  Currently, this involves
  going back to DARPA for awhile.  During that time, I'll come up with the
  specifics.  If I do that, this will get pushed off to next year, which is
  fine too, as it's better to get the plan right rather than sooner.
- Do taxes remotely.
- Do the best I can with learning new stuff.  If everything goes according to
  plan, I'm somewhat writing off 2012 from learning much of anything.  If I can
  maintain my existing knowledge/skills, then I'll be happy with it.  However,
  I do occasionally find myself with free time, so I'll be making as best use
  of that as I can.  Once I get back to the US, the master plan will go back
  into effect.  I've found it's tough to develop Lisp without internet
  connectivity, so I'm switching back to Haskell for the time being.
- Keep total expenses for the year under $4k (slightly more if I have to pay
  bribes for VISA renewals).
- Don't let being in Afghanistan cause any permanent brain damage.
- Don't die.

Once I realized this book wasn't going anywhere and was mostly filler, I
started skimming it pretty quickly.  There's a few okay parts later on, but
even these are shallow introductions to their respective topics.

Wrote the following for this book's amazon.com review:

As someone who's programmed on Unix for many years, I've known about esr for
some time, and probably should thank him for being part of a chorus that
encouraged me to learn things like Lisp. That said, my honest opinion of this
book is that it's a waste of paper and approximately the quality of a typical
esr blog post.

First of all, this book is not really about Unix programming. A full half of it
is dedicated to rehashing the Unix philosophy, history, and community. Yes,
these topics should come up, but at some point I want to read about Unix
programming, which is why I am reading a book with that phrase in the
title. None of this stuff has anything to do with programming, and is just as
applicable to end users.

The other half is supposedly programming related, but upon closer inspection,
mostly isn't. Major topics include things like tools, config file formats, and
a lot of general stuff that applies in non-Unix development too (like VCS and
network protocols). Where's the system programming tips, POSIX standards,
standard libraries, ioctl, BSD sockets, security considerations, and any number
of hundreds of other things anyone who's programmed on a Unix-variant
encounters? Yes, the book claims to not want to talk about these things, but
guess what, that's what Unix programming is all about.

Languages (you know, the thing you actually program in) are completely glossed
over, except to just list a few common ones. Half of the ones mentioned are so
portable, that programmers in them can ignore OS peculiarities the vast
majority of the time (Java, Python, Emacs Lisp). C, C++, and shell are very
tightly coupled to Unix, and much could have been said here, but isn't. Instead
of code, we're treated to reams of config file examples and other filler.

The various aspects of The Unix Way could have been stated in a single
chapter. Someone interested in becoming a Unix programmer needs to know where
to go to find documentation, what development resources he has available, and
other practical things. An MS programmer reading this book would be just as
clueless on how to start programming on Unix as before. Go pick up Advanced
Programming in the UNIX Environment if you want to learn this subject.

Skipped the first few chapters of stuff I already know.  I didn't like this
book so much at first, but it grew on me some.  It's not bad for a quick
refresher, but I'd rather the examples be more self-contained and more varied.
Of course, it's not a super-excellent programming book, but compared to most of
the trash in this genre, it's OK.  Only worked through about half of this and
then skimmed the rest, so I may revisit this later if the need/desire arises.

Since I have to listen to boring stories about people's jobs at work every time
I interview someone, just sticking to the ones who've done interesting things
or are likely to have interesting things to say.  Reading: Jamie Zawinksi,
Douglas Crockford, Brendan Eich, Joe Armstrong, Simon Peyton Jones, Peter
Norvig, Guy Steele, Ken Thompson, Donald Knuth.

This book can be a great read sometimes, but there are mountains of
uninteresting text between the good parts.  Skipping the answers to questions
that are too personal (like questions about their first programs and such)
tends to shorten the read by about half.  

I'm not sure every one of the guys interviewed here are really the best picks.
There's many more living legends out there and brilliant theoreticians, yet
we're sometimes stuck reading about some guy who wrote a CMS in PHP.  Others
have done a couple interesting things, but we have to listen to their opinions
on stuff they obviously haven't thought about much.  Of course, this is more
about "coders" and less about computer scientists, so the book delivers on its
promised content.

Some interesting observations:
- Most of these guys hate C++ and IDEs.  They also generally shun OOP.
- Most use very primitive debugging techniques, like simple printf statements.
- One problem I've always noticed is how to walk into a huge codebase and grok
  it fast.  Apparently, these guys struggle with that too, and there's no
  method that really makes this easier.  The most common method is to just pick
  out operations you understand as a user and walk through the code to figure
  out how its done.  Eventually, you start to develop a mental model.
- Most don't really do any formal SDLC-type design work.  Most of it is either
  rapid prototyping or just mental visualization combined with rewriting.

Good book.  Makes one wish books of this quality existed for every language.
Chapter 2's flow diagrams are rather useless, however (BNF definitions would be
more useful).

Took notes in ~/src/repo/javascript/jstgp and added some useful stuff mentioned
throughout the book in ~/src/repo/javascript/utils.js.

Skipping JavaScript regexps, due to it having it's own custom syntax for it and
that I don't want to memorize a bunch of alternatives for doing the exact same
thing.  I'll just Google that when needed.  Chapter 8 contains a handy list of
built-in methods.

Of course, writing real JavaScript involves a lot of ugly things this book
doesn't cover, like the DOM and its properties, memorizing all the built-in
utility functions, and using libraries.  I find the level of crap acceptable
using it as a general programming language, but with all that added by these
things, it's still pretty miserable.

This book really brought me from knowing next to nothing about JavaScript to
being at least competent in it.  It still doesn't feel completely natural to me
though, but that's mainly because I haven't written enough code in it.  I'm
sure that will come with time if it's really needed.  My only other comment is
that while I really appreciate the patterns presented in this book, the
language itself makes these rather cumbersome to implement, so I'll probably
try offloading as much as possible to lower tiers and maybe a little to
frameworks like jQuery.

A painful read, but gets the job done about as well as can be expected.  Only
read chapters 1-6 and 10-13.  The goal here was just a refresher of previously
learned Java language features/syntax, plus taking stock of the features added
since 1.2.  Since I read much of the 2nd edition of this same book back in
college, was able to speed read it.

Setup notes:
- To install the library source into a JDK install, grab the src.zip file and
  make a src directory in JDK home.  cd to it and run `jar xvf ../src.zip'.
- To install the docs, grab jdk-version-doc.zip, put it in JDK home and while
  there run `jar xvf jdk-version-doc.zip'.
- The corejava8.zip file is in ~/src/java and extracted there too.
- Entry point to the JDK docs on FreeBSD is at:
  <span class="org-link">file:///usr/local/diablo-jdk1.6.0/docs/api/index.html</span>

Notes:
- Use the appletviewer app to test applets outside of a web client, sending it
  the HTML file.
- Use <span class="italic">/** */</span> for block comments, as these nest properly.
- Makes a case for conventions (which I think I'll adopt) of putting instance
  variables at the end of a class definition and always using `this.' when
  referencing them within a class.
- Always use .clone() when returning a mutable data field in an accessor
  method.  E.g.:
  public Date getHireDate() {
      return (Date) hireDate.clone();
  }
- `main' methods can be added to any class and are a good way to do ad-hoc
  unit-testing.
- 1.6 adds the ability to include in CLASSPATH all .jar files in a directory by
  using this syntax (Note that the quotes aren't necessary on Windows):
  CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:~/lib/archive/'*'
- Valid Javadoc tags: @param variable description, @return description, @throws
  class description, @author name, @version text, @since text, @deprecated
  text, @see reference.
- See chapter 4's Javadoc section for more Javadoc specifics if ever generating
  full Javadocs for a particular app/library.
- When creating equals() methods, the parameter should be of type Object, check
  to see if they are the same reference, check if the other is null, check if
  other is an instanceof this class, cast other to this class, then do normal
  fields checking.  See chapter 5's equality testing section for details.
- Java collections cannot accept primitive types as type parameters.  Automatic
  boxing and unboxing occurs with collection method parameters/return values.
- Java can define methods to take arbitrary numbers of parameters, like this:
  public int sum(int... values) {
    int sum;
    for (int i : values) { sum += i; }
    return sum;
  }
- The `jar' command supports creation of jar files with manifests that specify
  "Main-Class:" which is the default class to look for the `main' method in.
- If doing a serious app, use the Preferences API.  This has advantages like
  being platform-independent and providing the ability to import/export them.
  For smaller stuff, use java.util.Properties.
- When throwing a new exception in a catch block, create the new exception
  object, then call `newex.initCause(e);', where e is the original exception.
  This allows for tracing through nested exception stacks.
- When doing industrial-strength logging, create your own logging.properties
  file and specify it at with `java -Djava.util.logging.config.file=myfile'.
  Otherwise, jre/lib/logging.properties is used.
- To debug classpath issues, launch the JVM with the -verbose flag.
- `javac' has a built in lint option.  See `javac -X' for details.
- Check out the GUI app `jconsole' for runtime monitoring of a Java app.

Like other attempts with using an audio format for learning complicated topics,
this works considerably less effectively than text.  But, if you're stuck in a

concepts here already.  The syllabus here is well chosen also, unlike most
programming language courses.

As suspected, I already knew the vast majority of the content here.  However,
since I use Unix all day, the few things found here will pay off for the time
spent reading it.  Skipping a few parts that don't interest me, like stuff
about non-Bourne shells, old VCSes like RCS, tape drives, vi, sed/awk (what
appears here is mainly just snippets from O'Reilly's Sed &amp; Awk, so I'll read
that on it's own sometime), etc.

Notes:
- Some useful utilities to keep in mind: cut, comm, sleep, fc, tpipe, od, hd,
  and fmt.
- inodes contain data about files.  There is one inode per file.  `ls -i' will
  list the inodes for files.  The `stat' command will list the contents of a
  file's inode, which include things like its ownership, timestamps, size, etc.
- You can background a running process by suspending it first with C-z and then
  running `bg'.
- Modified prompt in root's .cshrc to be red in reverse video with the full
  working directory path.
- Redirection operators:
  stderr to a file: prog 2&gt; file
  stdout and stderr to a file: prog &gt; file 2&gt;&amp;1
  stderr to end of file: prog 2&gt;&gt; file
- here documents let you input file data from stdin without creating a file.
  Here's an example, creating a file with 2 lines:
  % cat &gt; testfile &lt;&lt;test
  heredoc&gt; sdf1
  heredoc&gt; sdf2
  heredoc&gt; test
- Building strings with {}: This pattern-expansion syntax allows you to specify
  a list of changes to expand a single expression to.  For example, `mv
  file{1,2}.c' will expand to `mv file1.c file2.c'.  If not sure, test these by
  echoing them first.  One useful tip is to use `cp file{,.bak}' to quickly
  backup a file.
- The foreach control block does the same thing as in normal languages.  This
  works in csh, tcsh, and zsh:
  % foreach file (file{1,2,3})
  foreach&gt; touch $file
  foreach&gt; end
  In bash, use the for loop:
  $ for file in file{1,2,3}
  &gt; do touch $file
  &gt; done
- Using find's -exec flag can save an xargs call, e.g. `find . -name 'file*'
  -exec rm -i {} \;'.
- The !:n* (where n is an integer) construct in bash/zsh might have a use.
  This expands to the nth through last argument in the previous command,
  e.g. `cp file1 file2' followed by `echo !:1*' expands to `echo file1 file2'.
- The ^^ construct allows a replacement within the last command, then it is
  repeated, e.g. `echo hi' followed by `^i^ello' expands to `echo hello'.
- !-expansions can be checked with a :p suffix.  Then this can be followed
  with a `!!' to actually run it.
- `kill' can reference job numbers (shown in `jobs'), e.g. `kill %1'.
- The subshell construct () can be used for collecting output from stdout and
  stderr into a single pipe and for a series of commands that need to change
  the environment to run without changing the parent shell's environment.
- Use find's -o and -a operators to combine search parameters, e.g. `find . \(
  -name file1 -o -name file2 \) -print'.
- tar's z option can also be used when creating gzipped tarballs, e.g. `tar zcf
  stuff.tar.gz stuff', where stuff is a directory.
- `sdiff' is a side-by-side version of `diff', but it requires a &gt;80 column
  terminal.
- One use for `exec' is to replace the current shell process with a different
  program.  This can be handy if one of the programs started in this manner by
  my screen rc file dies and I want to restart it without creating another
  wrapper shell process and have it lie around, wasting resources.
- When running commands where the default umask (027 in my case) is
  inconvenient, like modifying a Darcs repo, a subshell can be spawned, wherein
  the umask can be changed without affecting the parent shell.
- Use the `time' command to log the runtime of a process.
- There's an ASCII lookup table in /usr/share/misc/ascii.

Learned a lot of useful tricks here, but many aren't that life-changing in my
case, since I use Emacs for complex editing instead of filters, screen instead
of job backgrounding, org-mode for office automation, and scripts in real
languages instead of shell.  Overall, this is an okay book and worth reading,
but includes a lot of filler sections just describing how to use some flag for
a program and spends way too much time on file editing.  It would have been a
much more useful read to me some 10 years ago.

Just reading the intro, part I, and the first few chapters of part II.  The
rest is mainly intended as a reference.

Notes:
- Maven uses a bunch of conventions, like ${basedir}/src/main/java for code,
  ${basedir}/src/main/resources for resources, and ${basedir}/src/test for unit
  tests.
- Check <span class="org-link">http://mvnrepository.com/</span> for versions and XML snippets.
- To create a new project, use something like: mvn archetype:create
  -DgroupId=com.macroexpand.mygroup -DartifactId=myproj
  -DpackageName=com.macroexpand.mypkg
- Other archetypes exist for other types of apps, like webapps and Swing apps.
- Use `mvn help:effective-pom' to see the aggregate effective POM.
- List of all maven.org packages at: <span class="org-link">http://repo2.maven.org/maven2/</span>
- `mvn site' generates documentation and reports.
- The pom.xml file can contain license and developer information.  See 4.4 for
  details.
- After installing stuff to the local repo, use something like this to run it
  `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.macroexpand.mygroup.myproj.Main
  -Dexec.args="my_cli_args"'.
- Get the full description of plugins using this form (the exec plugin is shown
  here) `mvn help:describe -Dplugin=exec -Dfull'.  In this example, it shows
  all the valid parameters that could be used in the previous exec call.
- View the project dependencies in list form with `mvn dependency:resolve' or
  tree form with `mvn dependency:tree'.
- Stick unit test case data in src/test/resources.
- To package and distribute a project and its dependencies as an assembly use
  the maven-assembly-plugin with a descriptorRef of jar-with-dependencies and
  run `mvn install assembly:assembly'.  See 4.13 for details.
- There's a maven-tomcat-plugin that could be useful for webapps.
- SNAPSHOT is a special version in Maven that indicates the latest code,
  typically TRUNK or HEAD.

Keeping this book around for reference purposes.  There's a lot of extra topics
here, covered in detail, that I skimmed or skipped in order to lazy load.  See
Maven under "Work-related topics" for more notes and some commentary.

This is the official Nexus book from Sonatype.  Nexus features I'm interested
in are: using it as a central repository and integration with m2eclipse.  Only
reading chapters 1, 2, and 4.

The link to the PDF of the latest version appears broken, so reading the
crappier HTML version: <span class="org-link">http://www.sonatype.com/books/nexus-book/reference/</span>

Notes:
- There's two versions of Nexus, Open Source and Professional.  The OS version
  offers everything I'll never need.
- Chapter 4 says to have Maven use a Nexus repo, one must edit
  ~/.m2/settings.xml, but at work, the pom.xml files just have repository
  blocks pointing to a Nexus URL like:
  <span class="org-link">http://</span>&lt;server&gt;/nexus/content/repositories/releases

Nexus is okay in that it occasionally fills a needed role in some development
projects.  But, it's also overly complicated and extremely boring to read
about.  If I ever miss reading about boring software in the future, I can also
check out Hudson, which is often combined with Nexus and Maven.

Reading chapters 1-4, and 7.  While it covers RESTEasy, it dedicates most of
the book to the other Jax-RS frameworks of Jersey, Restlet, and Struts, which
I'm ignoring.  The reviews of this book are pretty bad, so just giving it a
fast read.

Notes:
- REST is just a set of constraints that define a system: client/server,
  stateless, supports caching, uniformly accessible, layered, etc.
- HTTP methods: POST (create), GET (retrieve), PUT (update), DELETE.
- Created a Maven project for a Twitter client in ~/src/repo/java/resttwit.
  This app endlessly scrolls garbage from Twitter in near real time to the
  console.  After writing it, I stared at the moronic "thoughts" of the
  cesspool that is humanity for a few hours.
- The RESTEasy framework is pretty simple to use.  Use chapter 7 as a
  walkthrough while writing one if I ever have to.
- For RESTEasy, basically, you just define a class for each URI.  Within that
  class, you add a few annotations: @Path maps the class to the path (sometimes
  including parameters as extensions to the URI in braces), @GET/@POST/etc. map
  methods to HTTP request types, and @Consumes/@Produces map MIME types to
  methods.
- RESTEasy also requires a bunch of DRY-violating crap in web.xml.

This book is indeed pretty low quality and sloppy.  If I want to read up on
this topic more in the future, try the book "RESTful Java with Jax-RS".  But,
I'm calling myself reasonably competent in it for now.

overview of the foundations of mathematics and for large-scale context of how
mathematical subfields fit together.

This book did clarify my conceptual overview of mathematics some, so it was a
worthwhile read.  Chapter 7, in particular, is quite excellent and the most
consequential to the edge of theoretical computer science I'm most fond of.

Supposedly a non-rigorous introduction to statistics.  Reading this to make
sure I have a grasp on all the fundamental topics prior to delving into a more
math-heavy book on the subject.

Notes:
- Descriptive statistics are quantitative.  Inferential (analytical) statistics
  make inferences based on sampled data.
- In statistics, cardinal numbers are those which mathematical operations can
  be performed.  Ordinal numbers describe position.  These are slightly
  different meanings than the same terms in set theory.
- Only use non-parametric tests on nominal and ordinal variables (categorical
  data), and parametric tests on interval and ratio variables (numerical data).
- Nominal variables are named categories the variables can be in.
- A parameter is a numerical measure of some population characteristic, while a
  variable is the attribute of interest.
- Classifications of data:
  - Categorical
    - Nominal: Grouped into descriptive categories by name, unranked.
    - Ordinal: Ordered data, e.g. first, second, third.
  - Numerical
    - Interval: Difference between values can be state numerically, but not
      relatively, e.g. temperature, time of day.
    - Ratio: Numerical data where 0 represents none/nothing.
- Variables:
  - Independent: The variable altered/changed to find the effect on another
    variable.
  - Dependent: The focus of the statistical analysis.
- Crosstabs (cross-tabulations) can be used to summarize information about two
  categorical variables at the same time in table format.
- A frequency distribution is a tabulation of values for one or more variables
  in a sample.
- For categorical data:
  - One-sample chi-square test: A dispersion (how spread out values are),
    stating whether there is a difference between observed distribution pattern
    of data for a variable between categories or results where there was no
    pattern.
  - Mode: The most frequently occurring categor(y|ies) within a data set.
    Describes the "location" of categorical data.
- For numerical data:
  - Median: Middle data value.  If an even number of values, average the two
    middle ones.
  - Mean: Average.  Represented by x-bar (\={x}) when a sample mean or &#181; for a
    population mean.
  - Mode: Most frequently occurring value(s).
  - Range: Difference between highest and lowest ranked data values.
  - Inter-quartile range: Difference between the middle 50% of ranked data
    values.
  - Standard deviation: The extent which data values are spread about the
    mean, using the same units the data was recorded in.  Represented by &#963; for
    entire population SD, and s (or SD) for sample SD.
  - Variance: The extent which data values are spread about the mean, using the
    square of the units the data was recorded in.
  - Skewness: How the shape of distribution deviates from a symmetrical
    distribution.
  - Kurtosis: How pointed or flat a distribution is from a normal
    distribution.
- Null hypothesis: Represented by H_{0} (H, sub 0), the hypothesis that there
  is no significant difference/relationship between two or more variables.
  Significance tests operate by proving that there will not always be no
  difference.
- Alternative hypothesis: H_{1}, H_{a}.  The rival to the null hypothesis.
- Critical value: Provides the criterion that defines whether or not the null
  hypothesis should be rejected, and is the value for the approximate
  probability of the statistic occurring by chance.
- Errors: Type I errors are the worse, i.e. declaring an innocent person
  guilty.
  - Type I error: Rejecting the null hypothesis when it is correct in reality.
  - Type II error: Failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is incorrect.
- Testing:
  - 1. State the null hypothesis.
  - 2. Choose a statistical test.
  - 3. Select the critical level of significance, usually 0.05 - 0.01.
  - 4. Calculate the test statistic.
  - 5. Interpret the calculated probability value or the critical test value.
    This will determine rejection/acceptance of the null hypothesis.
  - 6. Interpret the test statistic.  If rejecting the null hypothesis, show
    support for the alternative hypothesis (though this doesn't prove it).
- There's a ton of statistical tests, good for varying kinds of data and for
  showing various relationships.  See this list:
  <span class="org-link">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Statistical_tests</span>

Not that great of a book.  Too focused on things like questionnaires,
presentation of results, and other useless items.  I wanted an intro to the
topic, but not one quite this stupid.  However, it was a quick read and not all
that painful.

Makes one of the same points made by "Industrial Society and Its Future", doing
a slightly better job at it, but is still poorly written.  I've generally
agreed with this concept, and conjecture that in some ways, its still possible
to live by these principles within an industrial context by forgoing some of
its standard participatory elements, like laboring for security, permanent
shelter, and a trove of possessions.

Observations (not all from this book): 
- The mathematics behind DNA matching isn't as complex as I'd originally
  thought prior to working in this field.  Most of it is very basic statistics.
- While the mathematics is sound, there are constants that are arbitrarily
  selected, like for minimum allele frequency.
- Another big problem is outdated population statistics data.  For legal
  reasons, no one wants to update these highly outdated databases, since it
  could potentially change the likelihood ratios of previous matches, thereby
  reopening convictions for appeal.
- Impressive sounding rhetoric like "1 in a million match" means increasingly
  little in random hits as database size increases (the potential for false
  positives increases combinatorially in all vs. all searches).  While not as
  bad given the US's required 13 STR loci completeness rules, EU and UK
  completeness definitions are way too low.
- Despite those (and a few other minor concerns), a forensic match is pretty
  much about as solid evidence as one can get.  Like everyone that works in DNA
  forensics knows: OJ did it.
- Attended a speech by this author and while he's one of the leading DNA
  forensics scientists in the world, and deservedly so, he's at the same time a
  Mormon k00k that believes some ridiculous things, like ignoring genetic
  evidence that links Amerindians with Asians, not Middle Easterners.  A
  perfect example of the small minority of religious scientists that are
  somehow able to turn off their brains when it comes to religion.
- Little does the public know, but the plans are in place to DNA sequence
  everyone any time they're arrested, pass through an airport or border, and
  anywhere else they can.  It's only the state and federal laws that need to
  catch up and the completion of development of networked "black box" profiling
  kits.  I estimate the kits technology will be ready in 5-10 years and the
  laws in perhaps twice that.
- Supposedly the law is that missing person and other non-criminal profiles
  won't be searched against forensic profiles.  In reality, the only thing
  stopping this is a rule not to click on a few buttons.

Read a good bit of this book, and probably know the rest at least peripherally
from work experience.  Since my career in this field is coming to an end, I
won't bother finishing it.

A good read, but for me, having watched much of Schiff's videos and read much
of his other stuff, a lot was highly remedial.  Also, I'd have preferred it if
all of the text was updated from the first version instead of adding updates
after the original content.  Lastly, while I can appreciate him wanting to
write in a manner to appeal to the largest number of viewers, I'd have
benefited more from added formal analysis and less FUD (however justified).

Reading the full archive of the "Intelligence Analysis Reference Library" at
work.  Some of these are full-sized books and quite large though, so will skim
as needed.  These are the recommended readings by resident analysis SMEs, but I
suspect actually reading these will be mostly useless.  Any knowledge gleaned
here won't be needed years from now, so not taking complete notes.  Skipping
the ones found to be related to direction finding radio communications, since I
don't care about the details of that topic.

Here goes:
- Analytic Culture in the U.S. Intelligence Community: Full book on
  touchy-feely industry culture stuff.  Not useful for me.
- Analytic Teams, Social Networks, and Collaborative Behavior (paper): Proposes
  a restructuring of having initial analysis done by a larger, distributed
  team, followed by final analysis by a core team.  Overall, pretty much
  useless.
- Anticipating Rare Events - The Role of ACH and Other Structured Analytic
  Techniques (paper): The message here is something that should be common
  sense.  Though, I guess government employees probably do need reminders to do
  things like check key assumptions and investigate the negation.
- AOC EW (Part 3) - VHF/UHF Propagation (page): Skipping.
- AOC EW - Emitter Location (page): Skipping.
- Assessing the Tradecraft of Intelligence Analysis (paper): Not bad.  Delivers
  the worldview of the intelligence community from the inside.  Not
  surprisingly, this view is a bit self-important and myopic.
- Cryptologic Almanac - A Brief Look at ELINT at NSA: Doesn't say much.
- The Ellipsoid and the Transverse Mercator Projection: Skipping.
- Fixing Intel - A Blueprint for Making Intelligence Relevant in Afghanistan:
  Makes some valid points about this topic, but most of this is pretty much
  common sense stuff.  Am I detecting a pattern here?
- Fixing Intel - Initial Thoughts: A critical review of the above by a guy from
  work.  Largely a realistic assessment of DIA analysts and other stuff.
- FM 1-02 - Operational Terms and Graphics: Might be handy for a reference if
  looking up term definitions or using a lot of these graphics.  Probably not
  though.
- FM 2-0 - Intelligence: Probably the one book to actually read, assuming you
  really wanted a full overview of this topic.  It's long though, so I just
  kinda skimmed it.  Might give a full read some day.  Had I known, I would've
  just read this in full and skipped the others.
- FM 34-130 - Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield: Has some okay
  examples of battlefield maps and such.  Not sure how current this info is
  though, since this copy is from 1994.
- Future Intel Analysis (Vol. 1) - Final Report: Useless.
- The Future of Alternative Analysis: Mostly just about how great ACH is.
- How Do Cognitive Pitfalls Limit Our Ability to Anticipate Rare Events?:
  Shallow, amateurish pyscho-babble.
- How Does Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH) Improve Intelligence
  Analysis: More boring stuff about ACH and about sitting around pulling
  probabilities for things out of thin air.
- IEW DF and Fix Estimation Analysis Report: Skipping.
- Introduction Into Theory of Direction Finding: Skipping.
- Introduction to Radio Direction Finding: Skipping.
- Overcoming Analytic Mindsets - Five Simple Techniques: Ugh...
- Psychology of Intelligence Analysis: A 173 book full of psycho-babble, so I
  think I'll skip this one.  I don't think I need to read things like a 20 page
  chapter called "Keeping an Open Mind".
- Q and Z signals (paper): Thoroughly useless.
- Rethinking Challenge Analysis: More pointless text about stuff that should be
  obvious.
- Small Group Processes for Intelligence Analysis: Bleh.
- Taxonomy of Structured Analytic Techniques: Just a grouping of techniques.
- Toward a Theory of Intelligence: Mostly a list of unanswered questions from
  some conference.  In other words: useless.
- A Tradecraft Primer - Structured Analytic Techniques for Improving
  Intelligence Analysis: Bleh.
- The Tradecraft of Warning - Overcoming Cognitive Barriers: Same text as
  "Overcoming Analytic Mindsets" but under a different title for some reason.

Post-mortem: Most of these texts seem to be written by and for idiots.  These
confirm a lot of my suspicions; mainly that the effectiveness of intelligence
analysis is overrated, often counter-productive, and that the field is mostly
populated with chair-warming government employees looking forward to their
pensions.  Excluding target analysis (which is slightly more immediately
useful), like most government employees, their output is at best minuscule and
often negative.

A bit gimmicky, but who knows, maybe I'll find something in here I hadn't

Update: Totally worthless.  Some of these tips are actually counter-productive
in my opinion, like setting up a personal wiki or setting your computer to
constantly download media.  Other tips are so obvious, you'd have to be a
retard not to have thought of them yourself, like clearing your desktop of
unused icons and using web browser tabs to load pages in the background.  If

Occasionally has some good hard scifi, but then ruins it with mediocre alien
stuff.  Annoying characters traverse a contrived (but not entirely terrible)
plot.  Unlike most scifi books, this one gets better as it goes on.

Attention authors: The kind of readers looking for the most realistic math and
physics are not the same people looking for love stories or sex scenes.

As a side note, while I'm usually somewhat forgiving about technological
predictions that don't pan out, the idea that a physicist in 1997 thought that
by 2004 (or ever) we'd be browsing filesystems in full VR-land is pretty
laughable.

Suffers from "too far in the future syndrome", where the author fails at the

future, and resorts to dropping modern personalities and concepts in a universe
entirely alien from the present.  Quit about 1/4th in.

  pretty good, though it occasionally strains suspension of disbelief.  In some
  ways, it's even better than the previous book, especially since it has a lot
  more original/big ideas.
- Manifold: Origin: Definitely the weakest of the series, mostly due to all the
  primitive hominid perspectives.

example of "post-humanist candy store syndrome".  Was unable to identify

Decent hard scifi, though as it was written in the 1980s, a few small parts of
it didn't age well, though they have little effect on the story.  Only
complaints are the alien culture had too many parallels with human development
and that some parts in the middle were a bit dragged out.

- The Moral Virologist: Mildly entertaining.
- Cocoon: OK, I guess.
- Distress: The plot here meanders quite a bit at first (or seems to), but the
  strength of this book is it as a delivery mechanism for criticism of the
  secular variety of anti-science and statism, and the only proper way to look
  at gender and emotional attachment.  This is probably one of the better Egan
  books, though the plot and some of the characters could use a little work.

A four book "big dumb object" scifi series:
- Rendezvous With Rama: OK, but not great.

  written by Arthur C. Clarke, this book, and the remainder of the series, are
  written by someone who obviously is an adequate writer, but lacks his vision.
- The Garden of Rama: Scifi introduced in this book is a bit sloppy and there's
  too much family crap.  About on par with the previous.
- Rama Revealed: The annoying stuff in here totally kills the few good parts.
  The end reveal also isn't worth the effort. Having read all of these, I now

This series is obviously written by someone either not trying very hard and/or
just not all that smart.  Also, these should all really be just one book, since
there's really no logical separation between them.  Excluding the vast tracts
of text that are constantly repeated would make it of normal length.

Some good ideas here, but the story and characters aren't that great.  The
introduction of the other sentient biological species seems a bit silly.  The
main problem is probably the personal perspective of grand scale events, though
this book does it better than most.  Though, like the many others, it goes too
far into the unknown while still trying to humanize the experience.  Another
big problem is super advanced science is basically presented as magic would be
in a fantasy novel.  Overall, it's still pretty good and keeps the reader
thinking, but the combination of enough shortcomings kept me from finding it
all that compelling.

An official Anarchy Online novel.  Supposedly the first book in a series, but
since it's been almost 10 years since it was published and AO development is
stagnant, it's unlikely there will ever be other books, which particularly
sucks since it ends with a bunch of questions never to be answered.  Available
for free on the AO site.

Surprisingly decent, but has problems.  The story lost a lot of its momentum
about half in and the parts in the far distant future aren't done that well.

While I agree with a select few of the points here, this presentation is for
idiots (and probably written by one too).

Anarcho-primitivism and new tribalism have some serious, fundamental problems
with it that I'm still waiting to be addressed.  I suspect they're intractable,
which is why texts on it tend to resort to emotionalism and hand-waving.

Had grabbed a copy of the sequels, but I think I'll skip it.

Acceptably average.  Nothing incompetent about this novel, but it's also
lacking anything interesting.  The main characters are boring, the identity
mystery is too obvious to be much of one, and the plot thoroughly predictable.
One good point is the focus on importance of augmented reality in the near
future, which by now is practically a sure thing and something often missing
from other scifi novels.

The Virtuous Misfortune: Crap.

There's some other fanfics listed on the Oolite wiki, but I've had enough.  The
Elite mythos is okay in some ways, but has a lot of dumb elements too,
particularly the alien races and how soft scifi the technology is.

Has some authentic defense contracting lingo, and while amusing to see it in a
fiction novel for awhile, it gets old.  Most of the technical terms here are
just awkwardly dropped in, in a sloppy attempt to harden up this scifi some.
Couple this with some signature Ringo ham (buxom lasses, military fetishism,
and unrealistically competent government employees), and you've got several

The new standard among SHTF/WROL k00ks.  Tons of Jesus crap, but does have some
good advice.  The collapse scenario portrayed here has a few plausibility
issues, but is close enough for a book like this.  Using real product names
helps, but there's so much of it, it reads more like an advertisement at
places.  Some tangents (like on SIGINT) just seem awkwardly misplaced, as if he
just wanted to include some topic he knew a lot about, but didn't bother making
sure it actually integrated into the story.  Overall, I'd describe this as
decent amateur novel writing (good overall structure/flow, pedestrian wording),
but one of those books where the author's worldview is all over every page.
That part probably wouldn't be as annoying here if not for all the religious
stuff.

There's a ton of recommendations for gear here, and most of it is pretty good.
This guy's obviously thought about it a lot.  A saner person shouldn't go nuts
like this, but have it be one factor when selecting firearms, knives, and other
normal stuff everyone buys.

Notes:
- Put URLs in a file called ~/.newsbeuter/urls
- Default browser is Lynx.  Since this starts a browser process each time, Lynx
  is faster here.

stick with it, at least until verifying JDEE can do everything I need.

Added some modes for the new job and got more stuff working in Windows.
- JavaScript modes: Added espresso as major JavaScript/JSON mode and moz.el to
  interact with MozRepl.
- Added pabbrev minor mode to give some typing prediction in JavaScript.  May
  activate this for other languages too.
- Added batch-mode for editing DOS batch files.
- Updated csharp-mode since there was a couple annoying bugs in the version I
  was using.  Not currently using this language though, so ended up deprecating
  it from my init.
- Added sqlplus to interact with Oracle databases.
- Got w3m sorta working in Windows, but it's still buggy in Emacs 23.
- Added Maxima support in Windows.
- Got elscreen working in Windows (required a manual install of apel).
- Added nXhtml, a much better mode for (X)HTML and includes MuMaMo for embedded
  programming languages in markup files.  This has some validation bugs I've
  noticed, but overall is still an improvement.  After installing this, be sure
  to byte-compile it.  Activate menu-bar-mode, go to nXhtml|nXhtml Help and
  Setup|Byte Compile nXhtml.
- Added YASnippet, auto-activated for most major modes.
- Added scala-mode, which is included in the scala distribution.
- byte-compiled many of the add-on extensions to speed up loading.  To
  byte-compile everything, run: C-u 0 M-x byte-recompile-directory

Notes:
- In nxhtml/util/mumamo.el, get rid of the extra \n's in the final messages.
  These fsck up my minibuffer size in xmonad.
- Disabling YASnippet.  This messes up the modeline in some modes (espresso and
  python-mode for example -- like, the flymake-mode text is clobbered) and I
  generally don't use it enough to be worthwhile.  Will check back on it in a
  year or so, maybe.

Not a high priority, since I want to minimize time spent on Windows anyway, but
there's a few minor things I could replace/add/optimize when I have nothing
better to do.  Collecting all of these tasks to do at once.

Installed:
- UFFunlock: Unlocker is broken on 2k8/Win7, so replaced it with this.
- Sumatra PDF: Less bloated than Foxit.
- Toad for MySQL: Considered replacing Navicat with HeidiSQL, but going with
  Toad, since it's actually used in work environments.
- .Net 3.5 SP1: Requires using Server Manager's Role Manager to install.  This,
  in turn, requires adding the Application Server role. :|
- PuTTY: Switched to this from SecureCRT.  SecureCRT has a couple extra, nice
  features, but I never seem to use them, so might as well use the smaller of
  the two apps.  It's also just a single binary, so will save me installing an
  SSH app over and over.

Consider for the future:
- AutoHotkey: Maybe set up some hotkey stuff for Windows, like mapping caps
  lock to control.  Look into possibilities for macroing certain repetitive
  video game tasks.
- Launchy: Might be as handy as dmenu for X.
- TrueCrypt: Maybe start using this for Windows encryption.
- Need to do some filesystem cleanup as well.

While this sucks, decided to use Lynx until this is fixed and upgrade anyway.

remember-mode, nxml-mode, and linum-mode are now part of Emacs, so deprecating
my own installs of those.

Updated Emacs font to Inconsolata-12 on FreeBSD machines.

Notes: 
- mysql60-server deprecated.  Replaced with mysql50-server.  xorg update
  requires restarting the dbus and hald daemons.

Finally got this working in Emacs after many painful hours.

Setup notes:
- Install Rhino.  This is in lang/rhino on FreeBSD.  On Windows, manually grab
  this from the main Rhino site and put it somewhere, like ~/bin.  In Arch
  Linux, this is in extra/rhino.
- Create a flymake-jslint.el file in ~/.emacs.d.  Make sure the call to Rhino
  is correct for the environment.  FreeBSD defaults this to rhinosh, but
  Windows requires an explicit java -jar to js.jar.  Added OS detection to the
  file, so it should work for either.
- Grab jslint.js from <span class="org-link">http://www.jslint.com/rhino/index.html</span> and put it in
  ~/.emacs.d.
- Add a require of flymake-jslint to ~/.emacs.
- Test by loading up a .js file and writing something stupid.

Usage notes:
- Suggestions should highlight.  Added C-c[ (previous error) and C-c] (next
  error) keybindings.
- For whatever reason, opening a new file doesn't work and will require
  manually calling flymake-mode once ready to start validating.
- See <span class="org-link">http://www.jslint.com/lint.html</span> for explanations of warnings.

Attempted to setup the lintnode version of this using node.js to initialize a
server, but this refused to work for me.  Investigate this later if I have the
time (run ~/.emacs.d/u_lintnode to grab the source and node.js is in
~/src/javascript/node-vx.x.xx).  This method seems fast enough on my crappy CPU
though, so probably no need.

Emacs 23 breaks emacs-w3m integration.  Apparently it's possible to get this

Notes:
- The new emacs-w3m adds search engine queries.  To use this, in a w3m buffer,
  just hit `g' and type `gg:&lt;your search text&gt;'.  This will send the text to
  Google.

Setup various machines to auto-authenticate, negating the need to constantly do
password authentication.  This is particularly handy with editing files over
scp with Emacs.

On remote host:
- For Unix-variants, just make sure OpenSSH is installed.  For Windows, install
  Cygwin with OpenSSH.
- Run `ssh-keygen -t rsa'.  An empty passphrase can be used.  On Windows, this
  often has an invalid default directory to save id_rsa.
- This should create an id_rsa and id_rsa.pub file.
- Copy the id_rsa.pub file over to the server.

On the server:
- Ensure that a ~/.ssh directory exists.
- With the above id_rsa.pub, run `cat id_rsa.pub &gt;&gt; .ssh/authorized_keys'.

Back on the remote host:
- Unfortunately, PuTTY requires keys be in its own format, so grab PuTTYgen
  from the PuTTY website.
- Go to File | Load private key, and select the id_rsa file.
- Now save as id_rsa.ppk with File | Save private key.
- In the PuTTY server's profile, under Connection | SSH | Auth, add the .ppk
  file, then save it.
- If only using one user, be sure to add it under Connection | Data to save
  typing that too.
- Authentication should now be automatic.

Did setup on: DREAMS to cellblock, DREAMS to sdfg, cellblock to sdfg, work
laptop to both work linux servers, work laptop to cellblock.

While Annotations are supported in JDEE, it doesn't support generics, enums, or
foreach loops (due to BeanShell, which is unmaintained and doesn't support Java
1.5+ and should be not used as a result).  malabar-mode is said to resolve
this, which also adds better Maven integration, a Groovy console, JUnit
integration (stand-alone and Maven), and refactoring features.

Setup notes:
- Add malabar-mode and build it with `mvn -f ~/.emacs.d/malabar-mode/pom.xml
  package' (requires a Maven install).

Update: Followed steps, but the tests always fail, regardless of which tag I
use.  This is probably due to either me using the integrated version of CEDET

Inconsolata is a better-looking font, but lacks much Unicode coverage.  DejaVu
Sans Mono on Unix-variants is almost as nice looking and covers the vast
majority of characters, including Asian languages and math symbols.  The latter
is of particular importance for using Agda properly.

- Add to fp in .xinitrc.
- Add to .Xdefaults.

Note that despite using the same font in both X11 Emacs and urxvt, the latter
doesn't cover certain character ranges.  Also, if it's necessary to get better

    '(add-to-list 'flymake-allowed-file-name-masks
                  '("\\.l?hs\\'" haskell-flymake-init)))

Took awhile to get this working, but finally managed it.

Update: Someone posted a solution to emacswiki with a pure Emacs lisp way of
doing this, which I'd definitely prefer to an external Perl script (I noticed a
few annoyances with the method as well, like stale flymake copies laying
around).  Added this code to .emacs and deprecating the old method to
unused_init.el.  This still requires commenting out the flymake code in
haskell-mode.el.

Just need this to get ENSIME to compile.  Only requirements are Ant and the
JDK.

Notes:
- Grabbed from SVN into ~/src/java/ivy.
- Run `ant jar' in that directory to build.  ivy.jar will now be in
  build/artifact/jars.
- This can be install on a per-user basis by creating a ~/.ant/lib directory
  and putting ivy.jar there.
- Go to src/example/hello-ivy and run ant.  This will test the setup so far and
  install ivy as a dependency.
- Added a script that runs `java -jar ~/.ant/lib/ivy.jar' to ~/bin.  This seems
  to be adequate for running ivy.xml files.

Seems like yet another messy Java project with poor documentation and that
craps a mess all over your user directories.  Ran the ENSIME build, but that
just seemed to grab a bunch of dependencies and I ended up grabbing the
distributed version anyway, so this was a waste of time.

Handy global minor mode to restore window setups.  The only time I think this

winner-mode's OK, but doesn't work when ecb is active.  Also, ElScreen is a

I ignored this feature since my directory structures were always maximally
shallow and sensibly named.  Unfortunately, not everyone at work shares my
philosophy here, so bookmarks will make life a bit easier.
<span class="org-link">http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/BookMarks</span>

Notes:
- C-x r m: Set a bookmark (marks both file and location within it).
- C-x r l: Lists bookmarks.
- To delete a bookmark, just mark them with `d' in the list and hit `x' to
  commit it (just like dired).

These are pretty handy.  Will create a collection of them as I find places to
bookmark in various work codebases.  Might also be handy for any JVM-based
language projects I work on in my own time, since these tend to require the
ugly Java convention of directories matching package names.

Seems useful enough on its own, but if I want to extend this feature some day,
check out <span class="org-link">http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/BookmarkPlus</span> which adds some nice
things like managing w3m bookmarks and changing font face based on type.

Sorta learned Ruby long ago, but have forgotten it since then.  But, it
wouldn't hurt to know how to throw up a quick Rails site.  Create a quick
practice site or two.  Only use an SQLite backend to keep things portable.
Don't put any real content on Rails though, as I definitely don't want to
actually maintain this environment locally.

Might want to use Groovy/Grails instead.  Think about this some before
committing to a few days of coding.

Canceled this for now, since I have considerably more important things to do.

This is an add-on to the stock scala-mode that adds a ton of great features
with more to come in future versions (hopefully).

This can be a bit of a pain to setup due to the poor documentation.  Once
everything's in place though, it's pretty nice.  Currently, it seems a bit
fragile though, since the server process barfed on me a couple times.  Keep an
eye on <span class="org-link">http://github.com/aemoncannon/ensime/downloads</span> for new releases.

Setup notes:
- ENSIME requires ivy to build, but it looks like this just drags in the
  dependencies.  Just run ivy against the root ensime directory.
- Even if doing this, it's still necessary to download the distributed version,
  since building the SVN version doesn't create a jar file.
- chmod bin/server.sh to u+x.
- Make sure the hashbang points to the correct path for bash for the OS

Project setup notes:
- Create a directory for a Scala project.
- Create a .ensime file within it.  Left a template in ~/src/scala/.ensime.
- Choose a build manager tool and make sure the directory structure matches.
- Change .ensime's :server-root to point to <span class="italic">/home/bm3719/</span>.emacs.d/ensime/dist.
- Open a .scala file somewhere in the project and run M-x ensime.  This will
  start the server, swank will connect to it, and the full ENSIME features will
  be available.

Usage notes:
- Unfortunately, ENSIME requires a GUI instance of Emacs to use effectively.
  Without it, you lose the echoing of types under the cursor and ability to
  double-click on package imports.  Looks like the most recent version added
  keybindings for these though.

Finished installing 0.0.20.  This still has some minor bugs, but from the small
amount of Scala I know so far, it seems usable.  I'm still not sure what the
official workflow is for using scala-mode, ENSIME, and SBT all together though
(there probably isn't one).  Hopefully this will become more obvious later.

Consider investigating the following later:
- Check scala-mode indentation.  If fscked up, maybe use this guy's:
  <span class="org-link">http://snippets.dzone.com/posts/show/5013</span>
- Use ctags to see if that makes the completion menu work.

Finally got this working.  This is pretty much essential to using Emacs for
production Java programming.  Now using flymake with the JDT core compiler.
This is a ~1.5MB stand-alone jar that doesn't require Eclipse (and thus not
needing all of Eclipse's massive dependencies).  Using the method that spawns a
separate JVM process for each flymake build, which is slightly slower than the
server method, but bypasses bsh.

Setup notes:
- Grab ecj-3.6.jar and put it in ~/.ant/lib.
- Put jde-eclipse-compiler-server.el in ~/.emacs.d.
- Make sure not to define the path of the ECJ jar relatively (wasted a lot of
  time trying to figure this one out).
- Make sure to specify `none' and not `/dev/null' to the -d flag, unlike what
  EmacsWiki says.
- For Windows, use a local Eclipse install and grab the JDT core jar from the
  plugins directory.  It should be named something like
  org.eclipse.jdt.core_3.5.2.v_981_R35x.jar.  Put this somewhere else, like in
  ~/bin, since flymake doesn't like spaces in file paths.  Make sure this
  filename matches what's in .emacs.
- It's also possible to do this without an Eclipse version of Ant, but still
  using the Eclipse core jar from another machine.  This requires Ant have a
  copy of jdtCompilerAdapter.jar in its lib directory though.

I need this for occasional Java programming at work, so putting in the time
needed to get this usable.

Setup notes:
- Don't use a JDEE version older than 2.4.0.1.  A ton of stuff is broken in
  2.3.x.x against Emacs 23 and it doesn't work with Java 1.6.
- Requires elib-1.0.  Switching all installs to a manual elib install.
- Designate browse-url for documentation viewing.
- Run M-x jde-compile-jde to byte-compile JDE.
- It's necessary to set jde-jdk-registry and jde-jdk, lest compiles not work.
- Added a custom control flow abbreviation for `main' in ~/.emacs.
- Modify first comment line jde-wiz-get-javadoc-template and
  jde-wiz-set-javadoc-template to include 4 spaces.  This sets the indent
  properly on the get/set method comments.
- JDEE's massive amount of features actually makes setting menu-bar-mode t a
  potentially useful thing.  Going to try to go commando for now though.

Usage notes:
- Most handy control flow abbreviations (type these in, followed by a space,
  and they will auto-expand): if, ife, while, for, fori, switch, try, tryf.
- Import generation: Auto-creates imports based on class names found in the
  classpath.  For example: Type FileWriter, hit C-c C-v C-z and `import
  java.io.FileWriter;' will be auto-added at the top of the file.  C-c C-v z
  will do this for the full file.
- Various wizards are available, though I'm not sure how useful these will be
  in practice, except maybe jde-wiz-implement-interface and
  jde-wiz-get-set-methods (which auto-creates get/set methods for all private
  variables in the class at point).
- Regarding get/set generation, another handy template is M-x jde-gen-get-set.
  This takes a type and name, then generates the methods and private variable.
- When using jde-run, if an exception occurs, you can walk the exception stack
  with C-c C-v C-[ or C-c C-v C-].
- Couldn't find any decent docs for prj.el files.  Here's an example file
  that helped: <span class="org-link">http://wttools.sourceforge.net/emacs-stuff/prj.html</span>
- Tons more, of course.  Keep the JDEE User Guide handy for reference.

Handy keybindings:
- C-c C-v C-c: jde-compile.
- C-c C-v C-r: jde-run.
- C-u - C-c C-r: Specify the main class and arguments to jde-run.
- C-c C-v j: Insert Javadoc template (put point on first line of method/class).
- M-x jde-javadoc-make: Make project's Javadoc.
- C-c C-v C-.: jde-complete.  Completes within the current classpath.
- C-c C-v .: jde-complete-inline.
- M-/: hippie-expand.  This integrates well with JDEE and can handle most
  completion tasks (much faster too).
- C-c C-v C-z: Generates an import for class at point.
- M-x jde-import-organize: Cleans up and sorts imports.
- M-x jde-create-new-project: Creates a new prj.el in specified directory.
  This is the place to set various project-specific variables, like for
  building the project and setting the jde-global-classpath.
- M-x jde-open-project-file:  Opens a prj.el file.
- C-c C-v C-n: jde-jdk-browse-doc.  Browse JavaSoft version of the JDK docs.
- C-c C-v C-w: jde-help-symbol.  Look up documentation for class at point.
- C-c C-v C-y: jde-open-class-at-point: Browse to the source of a class.

Replacing ditaa use with this, as graphviz is considerably more functional, but
I'll keep ditaa around in case I want to convert an org-mode table to an image.

Notes:
- Installed graphviz with default options.
- To convert a directed graph to an image file of some kind (in this example, a
  PNG file), run `dot -Tpng test.gv -otest.png'.  See manpage of `dot' for full
  details and a list of other converters.
- To include graphviz images in a LaTeX file, output to EPS, then run epstopdf
  on it.  After that, include the graphic in PDF format with something like:
  `\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{sa1.pdf}'.  Note that Text-Pdf mode must be
  enabled for this to work.
- Tried using dotty in X, but it seems rather broken for graph drawing, at
  least on my setup.  However, it is useful for previewing your .gv file.

Used graphviz to create a design document at work with a few graph images in
it.  I'm certainly no expert at graphviz after a day, but it's pretty easy to
use and I can lazy-load the rest as needed.

For future consideration:
Supposedly org-mode might have some kind of export capability to it.

  255.255.255.0 media 10baseT/UTP"' to /etc/rc.conf.  Then go into sysinstall,
  and detect the work network with DHCP.
- Xorg works with vesa, but to get it supporting large displays:
  - Install emulators/virtualbox-ose-additions.
  - Add `vboxguest_enable="YES"' to /etc/rc.conf.
  - In xorg.conf, set the device driver to `vboxvideo' and the InputDevice
    driver to `vboxmouse'.
  - Follow steps on <span class="org-link">http://wiki.freebsd.org/VirtualBox</span> to setup HAL.
  - If this goes correctly, mouse integration should be active.
- Differences from my normal FreeBSD setup (since this is just a development
  VM):
  - Didn't copy over all user data, just the minimal needed.
  - Installed mutt and msmtp but didn't scp over the config/mail dirs.
  - Skipping py-game/pyglets (might do this later).
  - Skipping CUPS and printer setup for now.
  - Skipping Samba, ddclient, and MySQL.
  - Installing Tomcat 7 (actually 6.0.29) instead of lighttpd.  Adding
    `tomcat6_enable="YES"' to /etc/rc.conf.
  - Had to add Firefox in order to use Firebug, but Conkeror is still on too.
    Adding `sem_load="YES"' to /boot/loader.conf for HTML5 support.
  - Installed Eclipse.
  - Installed R (installs a different gcc version).
  - Install Coq.
  - Didn't create symlinks for Ext JS.
  - Using GENERIC kernel.
- Bugs noticed: xmonad's frame highlighting is messed up.
- Backed up config at the state where the steps in fbsd_setup.org (with the
  above differences) was complete.  This was done running `VBoxManage clonehd
  /path/to/orig.vdi /path/to/copy.vdi'.  Using this method creates a new hard
  disk UUID.
- Use `dhclient em0' to renew the DHCP lease.

Update: Ended up hosing this setup and having to redo it while trying to use
VBoxManage to forward ssh.  This also killed my snapshots.  The only major
difference in the current setup now is that Tomcat is upgraded to 7.0.2
(requiring tomcat7_enable="YES" in rc.conf).

ESS provides an Emacs interface to various statistical packages.  I'm only
using it for R.  Here, I setup ESS, used it for a couple days, and read the ESS
manual.  Will be using this regularly at work, but I still need to spend a lot
of time learning R.

Setup notes:
- Added SVN checkout script, u_ess, to ~/.emacs.d.
- For Windows, just grab the .zip and stick it in ~/.emacs.d.  Be sure R's bin
  directory is in %PATH%.

Usage notes:
- Use `dev.off()' to kill various X11 windows (sometimes this acts weird so I
  doubt it's the proper way to manage windows, but it's better than xkill-ing
  them, since that messes up the R process).
- The ESS-preferred commenting scheme is 3 hashes for beginning of line
  comments, 2 for the current indent level, and 1 to a right column (column
  40).
- ESS supports an R documentation mode, which is written in a LaTeX-like
  language.  These are bound to .Rd files.  C-c C-e will insert a skeleton R
  document.  See mode help for more info.  Keep this in mind if I ever make my
  own R package.
- Roxygen can also be used for documenting R code (and then generating the .Rd
  files).  This is similar to Javadoc comments.  See section 8.2 of the ESS
  manual if I ever want to do this.
- ess-rdired provides dired-like mode for viewing the state of the current REPL
  environment.  Useful for inspecting and mutating the current state.  See mode
  help for keybindings.
- Added Rutils.  Includes more than just ess-rutils-rmall and
  ess-rutils-rsitesearch, but anything else I find useful will need a
  keybinding.

Some keybindings:
- M-x R: Start R REPL.
- C-c C-r: Send a region to the R REPL.
- C-c M-b: Send buffer to REPL and switch to REPL.
- C-c M-j: Send current line to REPL.
- C-c C-n (or S-RET): Send current line to REPL and move down one line.
- C-c C-v: Help on symbol at point.
- C-c RET: When on an old command in the REPL transcript, sends the command to
  the current prompt for editing.
- C-c C-c: Abort current command.
- C-c C-f: Eval function.
- C-c C-d: Edit object (data frame, function, or variable) in a buffer.  Rather
  useful for objects that have complex structure and/or have been modified in
  unknown ways.
- C-c C-l: Load (source) a file.
- C-c M-r: My binding of an Rutils function to remove all objects.
- C-c C-f: My binding of an Rutils function to search the R-help mailing list
  archives.

The ESS manual has a ton of additional minor editing commands that didn't seem
useful enough to write down, but if I find myself using ESS daily for a long

Just using AutoHotkey Basic for now.  The plan is to macro up game
interactions.  This will only work for some games, some of the time, since it's
not smart about things like 3d objects.  Scripts that involve clicking on
certain places on the screen will also be resolution-dependent.  I'll probably
only bother with this for MMO-type games.

Notes:
- Use the utility Window Spy to determine what X,Y coordinates I want for mouse
  clicks.  Use the "in active window" coordinates in scripts.  Use S-M-TAB to
  freeze the coordinates if in a full screen game.
- Apparently doesn't work in some games.  So far, it's non-functional at least

Apparently this is abandoned and doesn't work anymore.  Haven't verified this
myself, but since it was made back in Maven 1 times, I can probably spare
myself wasted effort.

Yet another attempt at JDEE Maven support.  Looks like this repo has been
updated as of this year.  The author claims it is abandoned though, but the
potential payoff is probably worth a look.
<span class="org-link">http://bitbucket.org/espenhw/jde-mvn/wiki/Home</span>

Setup:
- Ensure that Mercurial, Maven (along with a syntactically valid
  ~/.m2/settings.xml file), and the JDK are installed.
- In ~/.emacs.d, run `hg clone <span class="org-link">http://bitbucket.org/espenhw/jde-mvn/'</span>.
- In the jde-mvn directory, run `mvn package'.
- In the jde-mvn/target directory, there should be a file called
  jde-mvn-1.0-SNAPSHOT-dist.zip.  Run M-x describe-variable on
  "jde-plugins-directory" to find where to extract this to.  Create this
  directory if it doesn't exist.  chmod it go+rx.
- Run M-x jde-pi-load-plugins to load it.  This should add a JDEpi group to the
  menu-bar.  I had to restart Emacs though.  If all goes well, the next time
  JDEE loads when opening a Java source file, it'll scan in a bunch of Maven
  crap (and probably take a long time doing so).

To my amazement, this actually worked, sort of.  Unfortunately, there's a few
pretty annoying bugs:
- The compilation buffer is full of DOS linefeeds and garbage escape
  characters when kicked off from the menu-bar (at least on FreeBSD).
- Adding a dependency through jde-mvn's menu doesn't work due to some problem
  with parsing the pom.xml file.  Using M-x jde-mvn-pom-add-dependency does
  work though.
- Still can't figure out how to tie this in with flymake.
- I don't see a way to send different Maven commands, goals, or other
  parameters to jde-mvn.
- jde-mvn randomly decides to reparse my pom.xml file on certain files, but not
  others.

Usage notes:
- Don't use any of the jde-mvn menu-bar options besides Visit POM.
- To add a dependency, run M-x jde-mvn-pom-add-dependency.  If jde-mvn is
  already loaded, it should immediately be able to provide completion on known
  dependencies in the local Maven repo.
- Add the following elisp to the project's prj.el file, then load the project
  from JDE|Project|Project File|Load:

(jde-set-variables
 '(jde-build-function (quote (jde-mvn-build)))
 '(jde-compile-option-command-line-args
   (quote ("-Xlint:all" "-Xlint:-serial"))))

(with-pom ()
  (jde-mvn-set-jde-variables :include-dependency-sources))

;; Map C-c C-v C-t to run current test
(define-key jde-mode-map [remap jde-jdb-menu-debug-applet]
  'jde-mvn-build-run-test)

- To build, run C-c C-v C-b (M-x jde-build).

I guess I'll use this for now, since it seems to work okay.  Need to
investigate further with my "project management with JDEE" task to see if this
integrates well enough with the rest of the JDEE functionality.  I'll still
need to run `mvn package' from the command line to create jars/wars though.

Update: None of the standard JDEE built in completions recognize the
dependencies imported via jde-mvn.  I'll probably give malabar-mode another try
later, as it advertises integrated Maven support (among other nice things).
Uninstalled this for now as a result.

Research if there's a way to do the following:
- Have JDEE start a Maven build.
- Recognize a project created with Maven, even if that means redoing some of
  the pom.xml settings in a JDEE project file.
- Recognize dependencies in ~/.m2, which is in a huge directory tree.
- Add stuff in JDEE and have it show up in Eclipse if I then import the project
  as a Maven project (this might already work, but haven't tested it).

I'm still debating on whether to give malabar-mode another try.  I'd rather
stick with JDEE if possible though, since there's a lot more documentation for
it, and it remains to be seen if malabar-mode will really be the new de facto
Java IDE major mode for Emacs.

I also need a workflow for working with JDEE.  The list of commonly used
commands helped, but doesn't cover all the real tasks for Java project
management.  Create a test project with Maven and JDEE to demonstrate whatever
I come up with.  This test project will be a Hello World app with a single
dependency and two Java source files that do absolutely nothing interesting.

To create a project called jdeetest2 in ~/src/java, do the following:
- Run `cd ~/src/java'.
- Run `mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.macroexpand.jdeetest2
  -DartifactId=jdeetest2 -DpackageName=com.macroexpand.jdeetest2
  -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -DinteractiveMode=false
  -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.maven.archetypes
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart'.  This skips interactive
  mode and specifies everything that would be prompted for (though
  archetypeGroupId is optional to specify).
- In Emacs and run M-x jde-create-project, selecting the root project directory
  (in this case, ~/src/java/jdeetest2).

We now have a base project structure in ~/src/java/jdeetest2.  Note that this
procedure is preferable to the one mentioned under the Maven book task (which
uses the deprecated archetype:create).

Adding dependencies.  I'm using jde-mvn (for now) to manage these.  Let's say I
want to add commons-httpclient:
- Run M-x jde-mvn-pom-add-dependency, and type in the various dependency fields
  I grabbed from mvnrepository.com.
- Add the jde-mvn boilerplate elisp to the prj.el file (see jde-mvn entry for
  this code).
- Run jde-load-project-file to rescan prj.el.
- Add import statement `import org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpClient' and
  whatever code that uses it.
- Run C-c C-v C-b to build the project to make sure the dependency works.  This
  is equivalent to running `mvn build'.

To add a new class called Test to the project:
- Create a new file, Test.java, in the same directory as App.java.
- Run M-x jde-gen-class.  When prompted, use the same package as App
  (com.macroexpand.jdeetest2), and (in this case) nothing for extends and
  implements.
- Let's add a private field of type String called hello and generate a get/set
  pair for it.  Run JDE|Code Generation|Templates|Get/Set Pair... and fill in
  the self-explanatory prompts.
- Now I'll change App.java to use the get/set to store the message I want to
  see when the program runs.
- Add maven-jar-plugin and maven-assembly-plugin XML blocks to pom.xml so the
  jar file is runnable.  I usually just grab these from an old project
  somewhere so I don't have to keep looking it up.
- Build the project to make sure everything works.
- In a shell buffer, run `mvn assembly:assembly' to create the jar with
  dependencies (since I've got an external one).

Well, this works, but frankly, it still sucks.  I was able to get Maven builds
kicked off, but not every other useful Maven task.  I was able to sort of get
JDEE to recognize Maven projects, but most of the JDEE commands don't work with
external dependencies.  Since there's nothing essential to the build outside of
the POM, Eclipse will be able to load these projects just fine.

I've sunk a massive amount of time into getting JDEE to do what I would
consider very essential Java development tasks, and while I can develop real,
production Java code this way, it's needlessly painful to say the least.  JDEE
is a giant, bloated, buggy mess.

Still need to figure out what ecj settings to put in prj.el to get flymake to
actually be useful.  I've had enough JDEE frustration for a few weeks though.

Using this for some project management and browsing around projects, but most
coding is done in Emacs.  Did this a while back, but forgot to add my notes
here.

Notes:
- Install m2eclipse plugin for Maven integration.  Change the active Maven
  profile in the Maven group in the project properties.  In preferences, be
  sure to always change the Maven installation to external (that way command
  line builds always use the same as Eclipse).
  - Add install site: "m2eclipse Core Update Site" at
    <span class="org-link">http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/sites/m2e</span>
  - On FreeBSD, this requires a manual install of java/eclipse-gef and
    java/eclipse-webtools (drags in java/eclipse-emf and
    java/eclipse-datatools).
- Install Subclipse plugin for subversion integration.  If planning on using
  integrated SCM, setup an SVN Repository perspective and save it, so it's
  easier to jump to this.  I generally prefer to do this from the CLI (or using
  TourtiseSVN in Windows) though.
  - Add install site: "Subclipse 1.6" at
    <span class="org-link">http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.6.x</span>
  - Don't install "Subclipse integration for Mylyn 3.x".
- Install JSLint Eclipse plugin.  Be sure to uncheck the "Group items by
  category" button for its update site.  Don't include <span class="italic">/*jslint */</span> comment
  blocks, since the dialog settings override it.  Run from context menu.
- In Window|Preferences|General|Keys, set the Scheme to "Emacs".
- In Window|Preferences|Java|Code Style|Formatter, create a new profile from
  the default and change the Tab Policy on the Indentation tab to use spaces
  only.
- If using Hibernate, install JBoss Tools.
  - Add install site "JBoss Tools 3.1 Updates" at
    <span class="org-link">http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/stable/galileo/</span>
  - For Helios, use this URL:
    <span class="org-link">http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/stable</span>
  - Only install "Application Development|Hibernate Tools".
- Install FindBugs.
  - Add install site: "FindBugs update site" at
    <span class="org-link">http://findbugs.cs.umd.edu/eclipse</span>
- Install Groovy-Eclipse.
  - Add install site (3.5 only) "Groovy-Eclipse update site for Eclipse 3.5" at
    <span class="org-link">http://dist.springsource.org/milestone/GRECLIPSE/e3.5/</span>
  - Just install the Groovy-Eclipse feature and not the SDK.
- Install AJDT.
  - Add install site (3.5 only) "AJDT update site" at
    <span class="org-link">http://download.eclipse.org/tools/ajdt/35/update/</span>
  - Just install the core ActiveJ Tools.
- Install Spring IDE.  This requires AJDT.
  - Add install site: "Spring IDE update site" at
    <span class="org-link">http://springide.org/updatesite</span>
  - Be a bit selective here about what to install, or it'll require a bunch of
    dependencies.  At least just install the Spring IDE stuff.
- Be careful with the UI while installing crap in Eclipse in xmonad.  It
  doesn't play nice with tiling WMs and will sometimes hide modal dialogs.
  Always restart Eclipse after every plugin install.
- Check out CheckStyle in the future.

Eclipse plugins installed through the UI are currently broken as they don't
register in the IDE despite going to the ~/.eclipse directory.  Tried to fix
this for a couple hours but eventually gave up.  Plugins installed through
ports work fine though.

It's been like 10 years since I professionally used Tomcat, so I'm reading all
the official documentation here, just as a refresher:
<span class="org-link">http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/index.html</span>

Setup notes:
- Run `keytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA -keypass changeit -storepass
   changeit -keystore keystore.jks'.  Even though it asks for your first and
   last name, put "localhost" as the value, the remaining values do not matter
   and can be defaulted.
- Add the server to the trusted list:
  - Export the generated server certificate into the file server.cer with
   `keytool -export -alias tomcat -storepass changeit -file server.cer
   -keystore keystore.jks'.
  - Move the file (server.cer) to the JRE's lib/security folder.
  - Change directory to the JRE's lib/security folder.
  - Import the file (server.cer) with `keytool -import -v -trustcacerts -alias
    tomcat -file server.cer -keystore cacerts -keypass changeit -storepass
    changeit'.
- If on Windows, delete or rename tcnative-1.dll located in &lt;tomcat&gt;/bin.
- Create Directory &lt;tomcat&gt;/certs.
- Copy keystore.jks to &lt;tomcat&gt;/certs.
- Add the following connector to &lt;tomcat&gt;/conf/server.xml:
   &lt;Connector port="8443" protocol="HTTP/1.1" SSLEnabled="true" 
    maxThreads="150" scheme="https" secure="true" 
    clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS" 
    keystoreFile="certs/keystore.jks" keystorePass="changeit" 
    truststoreFile="certs/keystore.jks" truststorePass="changeit" /&gt;
- Right after &#8216;set CLASSPATH=&#8217; of &lt;tomcat&gt;/bin/catalina.[sh|bat] add the following
  two lines (changing $VAR to %VAR% in Windows):
  set JAVA_OPTS=$JAVA_OPTS
  -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=$CATALINA_HOME/certs/keystore.jks
  -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=$CATALINA_HOME/certs/keystore.jks
  -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=changeit 
  set JAVA_OPTS=$JAVA_OPTS -XX:PermSize=64m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m

Notes:
- Always check on the Tomcat Wiki first, at: <span class="org-link">http://wiki.apache.org/tomcat/</span>
- A single Tomcat install can run multiple instances, by setting $CATALINA_BASE
  ($CATALINA_HOME will always be the same).
- It's possible to run Tomcat as a service on Unix-variants using jsvc.  Look
  into that in the Setup section of the docs should I want to do such a thing.
- Tomcat expects certain directory structures, like the existence of WEB-INF.
- WEB-INF/web.xml is used to route URLs to servlets.  It's not required if
  there are none.
- WEB-INF/lib contains .jar files of libraries.  WEB-INF/classes contains all
  .class files of the web application.  Standard Java directory hierarchy
  applies here for package names.
- META-INF/context.xml can have Tomcat config options.
- The manager app (located at /manager) allows for runtime
  deployment/undeployment of webapps without restarting Tomcat.  This is sent
  with commands like localhost:8080/manager/deploy?path=/foo.

This was the most boring thing I've read in quite some time.

SMILE is a library for probabilistic reasoning using models like Bayesian
networks.  Currently only using on Win32 and with some internal test code.

Setup notes:
- Create a directory somewhere for jsmile_win32 (e.g. \bin\jsmile_win32).
- Put smile.jar, jsmile.dll, and the tutorial files in this directory.
- Create a BayesianNetwork directory and place the test Java files there.
- Change the tutorial2.net file path in ExampleMain.java.
- Compile in the root jsmile directory with `javac -cp smile.jar
  BayesianNetwork\*.java'.
- Run test code with `java -cp smile.jar:. BayesianNetwork.ExampleMain'.

Still need to write some code to use this and preferably some better interface
code.  Also need to look into getting a non-Windows version of it.

Update: For latest deploy version, dump the deploy files somewhere and run
`java -cp smile.jar:BayesianNetwork.jar:. Bnet.ExampleMain'

Augustus is a scoring engine for statistical and data mining models, using
PMML.  Augustus 4.x.x seems to be pretty much broken at the moment, so sticking
with 3.3.1 for now.

Setup notes:
- Install latest 2.x Python.
- Install latest py-numpy (Numerical Python) superpack.  Make sure the Python
  version matches.  This should detect the Lib/site-packages directory.  On
  FreeBSD, it's probably a good idea to binary install this, since it pulls in
  gcc 4.4 and its dependencies.
- For the latest version: Download from <span class="org-link">http://code.google.com/p/augustus/</span> or
  grab with Subversion via `svn checkout
  <span class="org-link">http://augustus.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/</span> augustus-trunk-read-only'.  For the
  last working version: Download from <span class="org-link">http://sourceforge.net/projects/augustus/</span>
- Extract Augustus somewhere (if grabbing a tarball), cd to the directory and
  run 'python setup.py install'.  This copies various stuff to
  Lib/site-packages/augustus and Scripts/.  Alternatively, set PYTHONPATH and
  PATH environmental variables (see .zshrc for setup).  I prefer this latter
  method, since uninstalling Python libraries still isn't possible.
- Now, just deploy the stuff from the mathematicians, which is scada, the batch
  scripts, and the Augustus Change Detection hierarchy.
  - scada: Extract scada.rar and edit both XML files to change the dumb
    pathnames to more sensible ones.  Move the scada directory to under the
    augustus-3.3.x folder.
  - batch scripts: Extract batchScripts.rar and stick them somewhere convenient
    (like in the root Augustus directory).  Edit the paths within the contained
    commands.
  - Augustus Change Detection: Extract this to Augustus root, and make sure the
    scada XML files point to it.  Change the directory names not to include
    spaces or capital letters.
  - Test by running edProducer batch script generating baseline (change
    detection) results.  This should produce a file, scada_baseline.pmml.
- I think I prefer the structure of the included examples which use Python
  produce/consume scripts and a directory convention for where stuff goes.
  Just follow the steps in doc/augustus-project-example.html to run one of
  these.

Was hoping to use the HTTP server, but this seems to just be a completely
generic server that does nothing Augustus-related.  In order to use this, one
would have to write all the Python code to link it with the engine (something I
don't have time for).  Might start looking around for a replacement in Java.
Closing for now under the assumption that this isn't going to be useful (which
would be a shame since I just set up a nice Emacs Python environment).

Update: Version 4.x.x. works now, as does the HTTP server.

This task is just to master JavaScript syntax and be able to write clean code
and be as expressive in it as other languages I consider myself good at.
JavaScript isn't a complex language, but it has a lot of ugly baggage, dumb
design decisions, and many other shortcomings that make knowing things in a
very exact way necessary (at least, if you're planning on writing any real code
in it).  So, though I've been writing it now and then for years, extra
formalized effort is necessary.  I'm throwing my lot in with the "JavaScript:
The Good Parts" philosophy, at least as a starting point.

Environment notes:
- On a box with Firefox installed, it's possible to get a JavaScript REPL up
  using MozRepl.  Install the MozRepl plugin on Firefox and the moz.el minor
  mode on Emacs.  MozRepl can be used to examine and modify the state of the
  existing document and even the browser elements.  This is very handy for
  rapid prototyping within the global state of a webapp, and the only way to do
  so with all of the zillions of files that typical make them up.
- Also in Firefox, install the Firebug plugin.  This allows runtime checking of
  errors and even a few decent debugging features like breakpoints.
- Another must have plugin for Firefox is the Clear Cache Plugin that adds a
  button to do just that to the toolbar.  This saves thousands of clicks and
  makes you less likely to forget clearing cache (necessary since FF tends to
  cache .js files and not check for updates).
- Firemacs makes Firefox more Conkeror-like.  On Windows, this requires setting
  ui.key.menuAccessKey to 0 in about:config.
- JSLint is handy for use with Emacs' flymake-mode.  This saves dozens of
  iterations of publishing bugs to a local test server, discovering the bug,
  then editing.  Also setup the JSLint plugin on Eclipse, but not using it.
  See JSLint/Rhino task for details.
- Autofill Forms saves a lot of typing, if working with forms a lot, like
  having to fill in stuff every time you want to test a webapp change.
- Lastly for Firefox, is the It's All Text add-on.  This isn't really
  JavaScript-related, but still handy sometimes.  Point this at
  emacsclientw.exe binary on Windows.  Associated e-lisp in mutt section.
- It's possible to install MozRepl on Conkeror for computers I don't want
  Firefox on.  One can to do most of the things possible in Firebug with just
  MozRepl, but it requires a lot more typing of commands.

MozRepl notes:
- For setup with Conkeror, see Conkeror entry.
- MozRepl has very few commands.  From a JavaScript buffer:
  C-c C-s: open a MozRepl interaction buffer and switch to it
  C-c C-l: save the current buffer and load it in REPL.
  C-M-x: send the current function (as recognized by c-mark-function) REPL.
  C-c C-c: send the current function to REPL and switch to it.
  C-c C-r: send the current region to REPL.
- May want to write some custom functions to automate anything I find myself
  doing over and over.

Basically, decent JavaScript web development requires Firefox, since that's
where most of the tools are centered around.  Apart from that, all you need is
Emacs, espresso-mode, and a Rhino/JSLint setup.  You can get by without MozRepl
easier than the other stuff, but it'd be a serious loss.  I'm sticking with
just Conkeror+MozRepl outside of work though.

Still want to check out JsUnit, but leaving that for a separate task.

Wanted to get a slightly better understanding of the mission goals of the

Read/skim the
intelligence analysis book/paper collection (see separate task for details);
2.) while in South Korea with an analyst, tried to slurp up some knowledge from
him on the subject.  I definitely know more about it now than before, but it
was also a bit disappointing to find the field almost completely non-scientific
and far more shallow than I had ever expected.  I knew it was bad, but not THAT
bad.  The mathematicians and computer scientists that work here are among the
best, but as a whole, all the effort mostly results in nothing.

Completed tutorial on main Ext JS site.  Added some of the code from this to
~/src/repo/javascript/extjs.

Installed extjs system-wide to be accessible from any site hosted on this
server.  This requires the following:
- Install www/extjs.
- Edit /usr/local/etc/lighttpd.conf and add mod_alias to the list of server
  modules like: server.modules += ( "mod_alias" ).  In my case, it was already
  in the default file.  It just needed to be uncommented.
- Add the following aliases: 
  alias.url = ( "/extjs/docs" <span class="org-code">=&gt; "/usr/local/share/doc/extjs" )
  alias.url +=</span> ( "/extjs/examples" <span class="org-code">=&gt; "/usr/local/share/examples/extjs" )
  alias.url +=</span> ( "/extjs" =&gt; "/usr/local/www/extjs")
- Restart lighttpd.

The Ext JS API is documented at: <span class="org-link">http://dev.sencha.com/deploy/dev/docs/</span>

Pretty boring topic, like most GUI programming.  Didn't really go all out on
learning this or read any books on the subject, but I think I pretty much get
it now, not that there's any underlying concepts to learn.  Hopefully, I won't
have to actually use it much (or at all).  If I'm feeling masochistic some day,
I have a couple e-books on the subject I could read.

Install, setup a simple one-node cluster, and try creating a database and doing
a few other things.

Setup notes:
- Install databases/cassandra.  This installs to /usr/local/share/cassandra.
- Edit bin/cassandra.in.sh and change the 8080 port default to something else,
  like 8081.
- Copy conf/storage-conf.xml.sample to conf/storage-conf.xml.  Do the same with
  log4j.properties.sample.
- Create /var/lib/cassandra.  I'll probably want to run this as a user, so
  chown -R bm3719:bm3719 this directory and /var/log/cassandra (might want to
  start it up as root first to create all the files and subdirs).
- Added `cassandra' and `cassandra-cli' scripts to ~/bin.
- Log in with cassandra-cli.

Canceling further work, since it turns out I won't be using this.  Cassandra's
still interesting anyway, so I'll keep it around and maybe use it as a database
for something of my own one day.

Update: Work pre-ordered the book Cassandra: The Definitive Guide.  Give this a

Apache ActiveMQ is a message broker implementing JMS 1.1.  Installing 5.4.1 on
work FreeBSD VM.

In this task, I'll setup an ActiveMQ service (running under a normal user), add
a queue, and write a simple JMS program to add/remove a message under that
queue.

Setup notes:
- Grab latest tarball from site and extract somewhere.
- Run `chmod 755 bin/activemq'.
- Change bin/activemq script's hashbang to /usr/local/bin/bash.
- Create a startup file with `~/src/java/apache-activemq-5.4.1/bin/activemq setup
  ~/.activemqrc'
- Modify this rc file to properly set $ACTIVEMQ_HOME; in my case, to
  `${HOME}/src/java/apache-activemq-5.4.1'.
- Probably want to run it with nohup, so do something like `nohup
  ~/src/java/apache-activemq-5.4.1/bin/activemq start &gt;
  ~/src/java/apache-activemq-5.4.1/data/smlog 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;' or just start it with
  `activemq start'.
- After starting, check if it's bound to a port with `netstat -a | grep 61616'.
- logger logs go to data/activemq.log.
- I had a `Cannot resolve localhost' error, but it turned out to be my fault
  for not adding an entry in /etc/hosts for my host.domain on my VM.
- Might want to add activemq's bin directory to $PATH.
- ActiveMQ includes a web-based monitor which lets you look at active topics
  and such at: <span class="org-link">http://localhost:8161/admin/</span>
- Stop the service with `activemq stop'.

Notes:
- Message persistence can use a database, but is defaulted to the AMQ Message
  Store.  See details here: <span class="org-link">http://activemq.apache.org/amq-message-store.html</span>
- Topics vs. Queues: Topics implement publish and subscribe semantics.
  Publishing a message to a topic informs all subscribers, which all receive a
  copy, and these will only be received if the subscriber is currently
  subscribed.  Queues implement load balancer semantics.  There is one consumer
  who receives a single message.  Messages will remain in the queue if there is
  no consumer.  It's possible for there to be multiple consumers, but only one
  of them will receive the message in a load balancing manner.  For my
  purposes, a queue is appropriate.
- To use ActiveMQ within JVM ecology languages, grab the activemq-all.jar file,
  which should be in the top level of the distribution.  If not using J2EE,
  then the lib/geronimo-*.jar files will also be needed (but only if using the
  ActiveMQ core jar).  Update: Managed to get this working with Maven, by
  adding a dependency to org.apache.activemq, activemq-core, 5.4.1.

Wrote a test program in ~/src/repo/test/MQTest.java to create a queue and
access with both a producer and consumer.  Compile and run with these commands:
javac -cp activemq-all-5.4.1.jar MQTest.java &amp;&amp; mv MQTest.class MQTest
java -cp activemq-all-5.4.1.jar:. MQTest.MQTest

OSGi isn't very interesting.  It's just a specification for creating pluggable
components of software.  I do like the idea of jar-level hidden-by-default and
using this as alternative to factory patterns (though, the need for a factory
pattern is the language's fault to begin with).

- Attended work presentation on OSGi and Spring DM (Dynamic Modules).
  - OSGi adds the concept of "bundles", encapsulated by services.  These have
    tool-generated manifests that define their contents and versions.
  - BundleActivator is an interface that defines starting and stopping of a
    bundle.
  - Spring DM takes care of a lot of the architecture of OSGi.
  - BundleListener/ServiceListener provide dynamic integration at runtime.
  - Apache Felix is an implementation of OSGi.
- Read <span class="org-link">http://www.osgi.org/About/WhatIsOSGi</span>
- Read <span class="org-link">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osgi</span>

After researching this, decided not to use it.  Too much architectural
overhead.

Maven is a build tool that, at least in the enterprise Java world, has largely
displaced Ant and offers more functionality than Ivy.  I'm already using Maven,
so the goal here is to just stop sucking at it and create a practice project.

Setup notes:
- Install java/maven2 on FreeBSD.
- With Eclipse, install m2eclipse plugin.  To load Maven projects, do a Maven
  import on a directory.  This will scan all subdirectories for pom.xml files.
- In Emacs, do something like this for the build command, `mvn -f
  /path/to/pom.xml package -Pmy-prof'.  This just uses the standard Emacs build
  tool though.  It looks like there was once a JDEE plugin for Maven, but it
  appears to be currently unsupported.
- Sometimes, it's necessary to manually put some dependency in the local Maven
  repository.  Use something like `mvn install:install-file
  -Dfile=~/activemq-all-5.4.1.jar -DgroupId=activemq -DartifactId=activemq
  -Dversion=5.4.1 -Dpackaging=jar'.
- Issuing `mvn eclipse:eclipse' will parse the POM file, install dependencies
  in the local .m2 repo, and update the Eclipse project's .classpath file.

The tools associated with Maven are terribly lacking.  The usage patterns for
getting things done with it are non-intuitive and rather dumb.  Using XML to
declare your build setup is stupid as it makes any conditional control awkward
and verbose.  Dependency hell is a constant pain and since it's often
impossible in practice to isolate a stable dependency tree of static versions,
it introduces non-determinism into builds.  The repository hierarchy tree is a
total mess and difficult to navigate.  Random versions of packages are often
not available, broken, or require manual installs.  Error output is often
useless or erroneous.  Documentation is sparse, forcing you to often Google for
answers on random sites.  Maven is painfully slow and has plenty of bugs.
Basically, Maven is a mess.

Some possible Maven replacements: rake, Lancet (uses Clojure), sbt (uses
Scala), and maybe APB (A Project Builder).  Maybe I can switch over some
projects to one of these sometime.  Maven 3 also supports actual programming
languages like Scala, so maybe this will solve some of the issues.

Now that I'm programming Java some at work, I need to get Emacs to do
everything that I can in Eclipse.  I already use Emacs for this, but there's a
few nice-to-have things that I don't have it doing yet.

Remaining subtasks:
- Read JDEE user guide.
- Read JDEE EmacsWiki page.
- Get flymake working for Java (jde-flymake, most likely).
- Maven integration beyond just using it in compile mode.

Update: Maven integration is no longer supported in JDEE.  Check back on this
next year.  This kinda screws up the ability for Java projects to see
dependencies in JDEE (which messes up jde-flymake).  Creating a new task that
includes figuring this out.  The environment is setup though, so closing this

- Attending a work class on this topic later (though after the above, I'm

- The Firefox plugin Poster lets you setup arbitrary REST calls.

Notes:
- REST URL elements should be nouns.

- The ocean has a noticeable tiling pattern to it, which is pretty sad,
  considering how little this game needs to do right.
- Game runs windowed, but doesn't update display when unfocused (sometimes it
  will grab input system-wide instead).
- Ship interiors are dead and lacking details (the patch helps this a little).
- No radio or GPS (apart from just your location).
- Lifeless shores.  Particularly a shame regarding ports.
- No wind and water current to factor in.

Not quite realistic enough to be a commercial driving simulator.  Still
somewhat entertaining for awhile.

Complaints:
- No cockpit mode.
- Camera makes it hard to see things like traffic lights and front corners.
- Traffic lights change too fast.
- Nothing like a "career mode", only short, one-time missions.
- Analog controls not scaled properly, particularly troublesome on turns.
- No pedestrians, motorcycles, bicycles, or vans in game.
- Pretty bad balance issues in regards to time.  Due to some of the control
  issues, it's impossible to ever get 100% on time.  However, you can usually
  safely ignore this scoring category if you wanted.
- Passengers teleport into the bus.
- Needs more long, straight highways.  Real roads aren't this curvy.
- Needs long distance bus driving, like between at least two cities.
- Though not really necessary, visible damage on vehicle models would be a nice
  touch.

Played through as a vanquisher.  Not really much of a desire to continue
farming on this char or make others though.  This game gets repetitive fast.

Complaints:
- WoW-style graphics, while not bad, aren't really my thing.
- Was never really a fan of this style of randomized item generation, instead
  favoring weapons/armor to be rarer and less often useless vendor trash.
  Vendor trash can then be various other items like mats, gems, etc.  Of
  course, the best item systems only drop exactly what the mobs are carrying.
- Reuses the same few random level styles too much.  Once you seen all the area
  types, you've pretty much seen everything.
- Ups the stats of the same monsters for harder levels.  Fighting the same
  enemies with larger HP bars forever isn't fun.
- Flintlocks and other primitive firearms don't fire this fast.  They also take
  ammo.  Then again, this game pretty much ignores any attempt at realism.

Still an okay game for a couple days though, but definitely no Diablo II.

Nice weapons and graphics, and better than the Modern Warfare series, but still
a tardfest.  Was in the market for some mindless fun after a few weeks of
interview cramming, but this was just too mindless.  Overall, a waste of money.

Complaints:
- Stupid health regen system.  Like the CoD games, your guy soaks up a few
  thousand bullets during the game, healing himself magically in a few seconds
  by ducking behind cover for 5 seconds.
- Treadmilling access to various weapons in multiplayer is a massive timesink.
- Tried multiplayer a couple of times, but load times are way too high, the low
  rank guns suck, and auto-healing kinda ruins the fun for me.
- There's only one team strategy in multiplayer: frontal assault.
- Single player campaign too linear and formulaic.  At least it doesn't have
  the near infinite enemy respawn problem that CoD does though.
- NPC squadmates are pretty much useless except for drawing fire while you
  regen.  However, as soon as you stick your head out, the enemy mobs typically

Decent game, but not as good as Defense Grid.  Did some of the challenge games,
but it got old before finishing all of them.

Complaints:
- Not being able to modify the path of creeps kills most of the strategy aspect
  of a tower defense game.
- Cloaking countermeasures are highly annoying.  Flare timer duration is way
  too short, resulting in a massive click-fest.  Inhibitor towers are better,
  but the range is frustratingly short.
- Survival mode more frustrating than fun.

Checked this out a couple years ago, but it wasn't really playable yet.  This
version only adds a couple new things on top of what I saw last time, like
starlanes.

With all the remaining features to be implemented, I'll just continue waiting
and check back again in a year or so.  Not in any desperate hurry to play an

4 new DLCs which are just packs of 2 maps each.  Picking them up in groups of
two, since not all are being released at the same time.

Of the first 4 maps, only Height of Confusion was really good.  The others were

Of the second 4, all were pretty good except Urban Planning.

Overall, a great game, and the most polished in the Total War series yet.

Complaints:
- Naval battles don't incorporate wind direction, one of the most important
  factors in sail-era naval warfare.
- No "raking fire" damage bonus, and you can't really "cross the T", since
  ships can turn so fast.
- During this period, riflemen formations fired volleys in ranks, usually 3
  deep.  Here just the front line fires and soldiers further back wait for the
  guy in front of them to die.
- No officers alongside units.  This was in earlier TW games, and would have
  been historically accurate here.
- Would prefer to be able to have a full map campaign with an infinite or more
  generous time limit option.  Campaign faction selection is also a bit
  disappointing.  Could have been fun to start off as a minor faction and
  attempt to conquer Europe.  Many of these other factions are available in
  multi-player, but that does nothing for me.

Got bored with this game apparently, since it sat unplayed for months.  I guess
my main problem is the world just doesn't seem as open as Rome: Total War did,
and all the other improvements can't make up for that.

Yet another EQ-clone, this one a free-to-play item mall one.

Complaints:
- Thoroughly devoid of any originality.
- NPC dialog and quest text reads like it was written by an idiot.  Dialog
  windows buggy, don't properly wrap text, and often don't recognize click
  events properly (like when selecting items from reward lists).
- Skill trees are very, very small.  The two char types I tried had the exact
  same combat routine for every single fight, and those were just spamming the
  same few skills repeatedly in an HP bar duel.  Only way later in the game did
  it vary some, and then only a small amount.
- Like every other MMO, the game world is populated with retards and perverts.
- Lots and lots of small glitches, like mobs spawning in scenery, disappearing
  parts of models, database persistence issues, etc.
- The PvP battle system has numerous design issues and bugs.  To get decent PvP
  rewards gear, you have to farm these battles for months, and it only gets
  exponentially worse at higher levels.
- Like most item mall games, the crappiness of various aspects of the game
  serve only to remind you to buy items with real money.  The problem then is
  that if you wanted to de-suckify all those things, you'd end up paying way
  more than just a normal subscription-based MMO.
- The game can't decide whether it wants to be fantasy or sci-fi.  I guess it's
  a combination of those, but generally it feels more like a cheap fantasy one.
- Like most 3D MMOs, you can walk through other players and mobs.
- No attack summons/pets capable of significant damage.
- Serious lag issues with the server, constant disconnects, and inexcusably
  constant and long downtimes.
- The most annoying thing about my char was that my main nuke had a minimum
  range.  This meant I had to kite around like a spaz whenever farming.  That
  got old extremely fast.

As suspected, got bored pretty quick.  Got to level 56 on an elementalist.
Overall, the game is just poorly run and the result of sloppy development and
derivative ideas.  Uninstalled.

Make an account here and try to see how far I can get without paying any real
money, perhaps by collecting sweat or dung.

Practically unplayable as a fr00b, so quitting.  Using sweat collectors
wouldn't be so annoying if it wasn't an aggro action.  One nice feature its
engine has though is that when running through dense foliage, leaves and
branches get bumped out of the way instead of clipping through the player
model.

The FreeBSD port of this doesn't run properly in my urxvt terminals for some
reason.  I had this working before though, so not sure what the problem is, but
it's not really worth looking into.  The little of the game I played before

Trying a 4 character party of fighter, cleric, mage, and thief.  

This went fine and was quite easy up until I stuck my party by going to ToL too
soon.  The final ToL battle is extremely tough, even for a 6 char party, and
while I'm sure I could take it in a few levels, jumping there shortly after HoW
was available was just stupid.  In retrospect, I also should've dual-classed my
cleric and theif to start as fighters and switch to their main classes after
level 1 or so.  I could also change the fighter to a dual-classed bard to
offset the OP-factor of this.

I could salvage this from an earlier save, but redoing all of ToL just doesn't
sound like fun.  Maybe I'll start over again in a few years, though I've played
through this game so many times now, that it's really not enjoyable anymore.

AO is better than I thought it'd be.  The graphics look nice on modern
machines, load times are near-instantaneous, most buffs are long-lasting, and
the game doesn't hold the player's hand like modern MMOs do.  Probably my
favorite thing about it is that the game world is massive and the population
extremely low (at least on the RK2 server).  You can easily run for hours in
one direction without seeing another player.

Playing a nanomage metaphysicist, a min/max build focusing on passive play.
For harder mobs, I can help out the pet summons with some nukes, but otherwise,
the goal is to do nothing, weilding 1HB buff weapons (shields,
pillows/cushions) or low QL buff pistols.  Previously tried ranged weapon MPs,
but those chars were doomed to be sub-par (IMO), since I had to spread IP
around to too many combat skills.

Read all the relevant info online I could find and made a detail build plan
with the info at hand in ~/doc/misc/metaphysicist_notes.org.  AO has a lot of
opportunities for gimping your char, so this plan should prevent that.  Wrote
some AutoHotkey scripts to automate as much as I could, but for whatever
reason, AutoHotkey and AO don't work together.

Complaints:
- No auto-loot.  Clicking corpses to loot gets old, fast.  Making it worse is
  the focus is lost on a mob as it dies, meaning if you had it targeted and
  killed it, you'd have to re-target to loot.  This isn't as terrible as it
  would be in most games, since you kill fewer mobs overall, however.
- There's some annoying graphical glitches and still plenty of bugs.  There's
  really no excuse for this given that the game's been out for almost 10 years.
- The game has already suffered from years of game currency inflation and all
  the typical side effects of that.
- The pet's hunt function typically causes it to wander outside its 50m pet
  radius and default back into guard mode.  Of course, without auto-loot this
  function is less useful anyway.  It can still be used to farm up some n00b
  mobs occasionally though and other situations where the farm area is
  geographically restricted.
- Leveled XP.  Like most modern MMOs, you get no XP for killing gray con mobs.
  At least this game still gives you their drops though, making it possible to
  catch up if you've out-leveled your equipment.  Some areas are also have
  level limits on entry.
- Not a big fan of item systems that have minimum stats to equip, but at least
  most of the items aren't level-restricted.  Also has NODROP and UNIQUE items.
- AO's developer (Funcom) intends to upgrade the engine to the AoC engine.
  While most players might like this, I'd rather have the current graphics and
  instantaneous zone loads.
- The Shadowlands area has a ton of problems, but the main one is that it
  throws out a lot of the good things about AO and copies the more modern MMOs
  (e.g., a linear progression of areas, distinct good/evil factions, etc).

Got bored after a few weeks.  Made it to level 36 or so, and lost all desire to
continue playing.  In retrospect, I think I'd have enjoyed the game more as a
fr00b, as apart from perks/research, the pay expansion content sucks.

Part 1 of a 7 part series.  Looked like an interesting 2D isometric game.
Didn't disappoint on graphics, sound, or atmosphere, and has an original system
of stats/skills, but fell short in most other areas.

Complaints:
- The story is rather dumb so far.  Most of this is due to the actual text of
  the narration and dialog, which fails at its intended goal of being poetic.
- The environment is almost entirely non-interactive.
- Not really big on feelings, dreams, and other touchy-feely stuff like that.
- While original, the stats/skills system could have been better thought out.
  For example, having to dedicate stat points to making the game harder is
  kinda dumb.
- Settings refuse to accept a change to 16:10 aspect ratio.
- Dialog choices often lack in any real consequence.
- Uses Adobe AIR, which is probably what makes parts of it feel like a casual
  Flash game, albeit a very polished one.
- Controls are a bit crappy and unresponsive.
- Combat actions and spells lack sound effects.
- Boring to play, and not the good kind of boring.

Gave up after a few hours.  Overall, a waste of $5.

    - State "STARTED"    <span class="org-date">[2010-07-17 Sat 19:16]</span>
Setup notes:
- Grab both BG and SI from: <span class="org-link">http://www.abandonia.com/</span>
- Make an `exult' directory somewhere and extract both zip files to
  `exult/ultima7' and `exult/serpent'.
- Run Exult installer, installing to the `exult' directory created above and
  point to the BG/SI locations appropriately.
- Putz with the resolution settings in exult.cfg until something close to a
  window the size of the screen is found, but only go this large if the screen
  isn't more than like 1280x960 or so, since then it would require to much
  mousing to run.  Don't use fullscreen, since it's pretty buggy.
- Change bg_paperdolls to no, since the other kind make it hard to see who's
  wearing what and accessing the backpack is more difficult.
- Run Exult and start stealing food.

Complaints:
- The controls are pretty bad sometimes.  It's hard to click small items and
  stuff is often in the way of other stuff you do want to select.  The higher
  resolution available with Exult makes up for cramped UI, but doesn't help
  clicking things.
- Combat is so fast, it's often impossible to do anything strategic during it.
- Checking the party's stats is a massive amount of clicking and their max HP
  isn't shown.
- No ability to sell most stuff to stores kinda ruins the fun of collecting
  since found items have no value unless you can use them yourself.
- Couldn't get most sound effects to work in Exult.  The background music works
  fine though.  Probably could putz with the sound settings some, but didn't
  bother.

Despite these complaints, Ultima VII is a truly epic game and way ahead of its
time in sandbox world creation.  Even most modern games that attempt the same
fall short of many of the features this has.

Kind of abandoned this effort due to lack of interest in the main plot line.
Played it in sandbox mode until I effectively maxed out all my chars though.
This kept me sane while stuck on work trips, so I'm keeping it around for
future ones and may continue here then.

Already played this some before, but giving it another run through.  Considered
buying the 2 expansion packs, but since they just add a few units and
technologies, not bothering with it.  This is a really well-made game from a
gameplay perspective, but it's not perfect.

Complaints:
- Though the graphics are 3D, the game is effectively 2D.  Would've been more
  interesting with jump ranges (perhaps as a research-increasing technology)
  that allowed jumping to any nearby planet, no phase jump lanes, and the
  occasional orbiting body off the ecliptic plane.  The ability to setup bases
  in random locations in space would've been nice too.
- Actual combat doesn't have many strategic options.
- Diplomacy is implemented rather stupid.  Attempting to keep allies happy or
  befriend other factions is often impossible, since you sometimes can't do
  their quests (especially in larger maps).
- Scenarios tend to be intentionally designed for one resource to be in
  constant shortage, usually crystal, which just ends up being annoying.
- Would be nice to be able to turn down the pirate faction instead of it always
  being exactly the same strength or completely disabling it.
- Though the ability to zoom from system view down to planetary orbit is cool,
  the scale is way off.
- Would prefer a little more realism.  Like grouping planet types together in
  accurate distances from their star (i.e. no Terran planets way out in distant
  space), including moons of varying size and usefulness, asteroid belts that
  are actually belts, etc.

Observations for 2010:
- I needed a good bit of the first 2 or 3 months of this year refreshing old
  development knowledge in order to breeze through interviews.  While
  that sucked, the end result was certainly worth it.
- Switching jobs to a more programming-intensive one was the right move, but it
  also threw out half of my SE knowledge due to switching dev ecologies.  The
  most important effect here is that I had to invest most of the year
  researching work-related topics.
- Moving slurped up a good month of productive time.  This was and is worth it
  though, as now I can walk to work when weather permits.
- Compared to where I was last year at this time, I can unequivocally state
  that I have made progress in a vast number of major areas: Better living
  conditions (nicer apartment and better location), improved monetary
  efficiency (about 30% reduced expenses), reduced extraneous possessions
  (around 700 lbs), greatly expanded programming skill (mostly work-related),
  healthier (almost 30lbs lighter), increased monetary net worth (over +$80k),
  improved career standing (more advanced job and another clearance upgrade),
  around twice as many books read, less time spent on frivolous activity (like
  playing video games), better work conditions (and more pay), and while I've
  still got some major tasks ahead of me, my life is getting close to maximal
  optimization.  Of course, things out of my control could always throw large
  parts of it out of balance, but that's why I'm on my way to reducing, and
  eventually eliminating, the greatest source of instability, risk, and
  inefficiency: work.  Getting there as fast as possible requires running life
  like a business, and that's exactly what this file is all about.

Major goals for next year:
- The main goal now is to max out the savings rate.  I need to save at least
  $75K/yr in order to meet my retirement goal.  That shouldn't be too much of a
  challenge at my current rate.  Ignoring this will just mean I have to work
  longer.  CompSci is still my main long-term goal, but securing my freedom is
  far more valuable to my personal wealth than writing code for employers, and
  is also a necessary step to write the code I want to.  I've now got a 5 year
  plan, starting now, to get to where I need to retire (detailed in
  ~/ideas.org).  Meeting or exceeding the yearly milestones therein is my
  primary focus.  Due to the timescale, there are some major risk factors
  (macroeconomic crises, my target industry collapsing, layoffs, medical
  emergencies, and burnout).  I'm sure I'll encounter at least one of these in
  that time, and I can only buffer myself as best I can.  Making it to next
  year while still on track will be a huge step in the right direction.
- Finish learning new job skills.  The only remaining items are Hibernate and
  Spring, so this shouldn't take long.
- Finish these life goals: losing weight, quitting smoking, curing caffeine
  addiction, finish firearms collection, learn how to grow food, and
  liquidating remaining extraneous possessions.  Life will be a great deal
  better once these are complete, as apart from the retirement target plan,
  these are the last big aspects of life to address while still in employment
  mode (or, at least of the ones I can think of now).
- Once all the above is accomplished, return to my CompSci goals which are
  still the same as before, and, of course, keep thinking of ways to improve
  life.

Notes:
- A state transformer monad can be used to explicitly indicate an array is
  single-threaded.
- Keep monads in mind when creating recursive descent parsers in the future.

Wrote the following for this book's amazon.com review:

I (perhaps naively) attempted to use this book to educate myself on SSIS, SSAS,
and SSRS.  This is an awful, terrible, retarded book, even for Microsoft Press.
Here's just a few of its many problems:
- 90% of its content is just walkthroughs, most likely pasted in from MS help
  docs and KB articles.
- No actual educational surveys of the topics in chapters are provided, apart
  from a couple paragraphs introducing it and telling you how thankful you
  should be that MS added some lame features to it in this version.
- The walkthroughs are literally unreadable unless you're actually performing
  that task right now.  What few explanations of concepts there are, are buried
  in reams of "click this button, now click the drop-down selector, now click
  OK."
- This presentation becomes instantly useless when a new version comes out
  (which already happened) since the text is married to this version's GUI.
- The occasional typo and grammar error complete the tardfest.

Basically, this book is just 1200 pages of filler with a hardcover for
cubicle-shelf eyewash purposes.  Only the most clueless MS weenies would
actually use this for a reference on the job when the KB has the same thing,
only more up to date.  Even more pathetic is it took 5 people to "write" this.
Typical mall bookstore-grade tech book detritus.

Quit around chapter 12.  While there are some important ideas in number theory,
proof theory, and the incompleteness theorem presented in this book, it tends
to be drowned in a sea of nonsensical, hypothetical pseudo-isomorphisms between
those math topics and music, art, and fiction, effectively introducing
unnecessary noise.  Maybe it would be okay for readers in need of a lot of
hand-holding and relations between these semi-complicated topics and everyday
life, but I think I can say this doesn't apply to me, at least not with math.
Another bad thing about it is that there are some ideas of obviously
questionable merit, in particular the "strange loop" which the author seems
hung up on (his followup book is entirely about strange loops).  The book isn't
terrible, but I have better things to do with my time, already know most of
this, and what I don't I can learn elsewhere much faster.

Hard scifi author with some original ideas and who's mostly free of a lot of

but there's more books of his I'll consider reading later.

- Glory: Pretty good.
- Oceanic: Pretty good.
- Luminous: Pretty good.
- Dark Integers: Not bad.
- Singleton: OK, not great.

- The Demon's Passage: Very good.
- Oracle: Not bad.
- Closer: Pretty good.
- Neighbourhood Watch: Meh.
- TAP: Decent.
- Quarantine: Pretty good.  Ending a bit disappointing.  Somehow manages to
  turn his only Copenhagen interpretation book into another MWI one. :\
- Schild's Ladder: Some of the math/physics used here reads a bit tacked on
  instead of integral to the story and is too focused on the developments of
  the (actual) present.  Despite having post-human brains, the characters also
  regularly engage in vacuous dialog.  Still a great book, but won't be
  entertaining 20,000 years from now (when the story takes place).
- Dust: Pretty good.  Ending a bit sloppy.
- Wang's Carpets: Also included in Diaspora.  Pretty good on its own too.

The good: This book sort of explores the interesting topic of Von Neumann
probes.

The bad: Everything else.  The execution of this is almost exclusively composed
of lots of pointless filler and braindead dialog, making for a highly annoying
read.  The world is ending, and the reader is treated to scenes with puppies,
detailed meal descriptions, relationship drama, and other trivialities.  No
character ever once says anything intelligent.  Plot-progressing events are
completely random, giving the reader nothing to ponder or do except turn the
page.  Finishing this turned into a real chore.

Wrote the following for this book's amazon.com review:

Apparently it really is possible to spend too much time with the GNU Manifesto.
At least we can take comfort in the knowledge that the personal lubricant
industry will do well as the technological singularity approaches.

Some observations:
- This book isn't bad, but for someone whose lexicon includes all the
  post-humanist buzzwords (of which a near complete survey is made herein),
  it's pretty obvious the underlying stories here are a bit weak.  The
  shamelessly heavy obscurantism here doesn't work for anyone with a CompSci
  degree and who's read all of the transhumanism Wikipedia articles.
- Characters suffer from what I like to call "post-humanist candy store
  syndrome" where post-human characters in a scifi novel have complete control
  over their (either real or virtual) environment, and go nuts with overdone
  immaturity interacting with it (i.e. morphing into ridiculous monsters and
  living out other childish fantasies).  Even modern humans would get bored of
  this pretty quick.
- Obviously written by an OOP fanboi.  References to Python and Java are pretty
  laughable early on in the book.  No attempt is made to continue the detail of
  following programming language development after a few chapters, probably as
  a result of the author being incapable of speculation in this area.
- Along those lines, the hard scifi level of detail gets continuously more
  sloppy as the book goes on.
- Anti-Objectivist/pro-communist propaganda is laced into the early plot in
  such a heavy-handed fashion as to just be awkward.
- Has several "well, that's just stupid" moments, like killing gray goo with
  fuel-air explosives bombing and most everything involving the
  extra-terrestrials encounter.
- Exhibits what I'll hereby christen "historical gravity well syndrome" where a
  scifi novel tries to fill in back-story in a way that over-emphasizes the
  history of the decade or so before it was written (i.e. talking about Richard
  Stallman, George Soros, Noam Chomsky, a thinly-veiled RIAA, etc., yet nearly
  completely ignoring the history from the present until the beginning of the
  book).  Do humans today spend all their time talking about the 1960s while
  ignoring everything since then?
- Most importantly, the book's universe is basically the myopic worldview of
  the salivating Linux freetards.  This makes for a lot of cringe-worthy scenes
  and dialog that read more like a Slashdot post than an actual novel.
- Despite all the above, it's still nice to see ideas like Matrioshka brains,
  lightsails, computronium, distributed intelligence, and exocortices come to
  life, but none of these ideas are original to this book.  Hopefully someone
  less simple-minded will write a better book about them some day.

Deprecating Gnus in favor of wl for email and newsticker.el for RSS.  Might
revisit this if I get another working NNTP server from a future ISP (though, wl
also supports NNTP).  Otherwise, the command syntax overhead and Gnus' awkward
handling of non-Usenet sources makes it less than ideal for the tasks I was
still using it for.  While Gnus probably is still the best NNTP reader, the
need for one has largely vanished, as I have better things to do than killfile

Considerably better than Gnus, but a bit heavy on the dependencies.

A few basic keybindings for quick reference:

C-c C-c send in compose mode
s - update summary
a - reply w/o citation
A - reply w/ citation
D - mark for delete

Only weird thing is that in testing, it seemed to generate a lot of junk

Overall, wl seems pretty good, but mutt still might be a little better.  Will

Did setup for C.  Might want to look into C++, yacc, Java, and PHP4 later,

a symbol, not just its definition.

Some notes:
- Create a folder for C project and start creating source files in it.  Then,
  run gtags -v in that folder which will generate various G-files.
- When looking for the definition of a function, run M-x gtags-find-tag and
  type in the func name (will auto-populate if in that function call's scope)
  and it will navigate to the definition.
- To enable auto completion of function names\symbols etc: M-x
  gtags-make-complete-list

- If more than one is found a stack is returned.  Select one and hit RET.  In

Read dired sections of Emacs manual.  After using dired for awhile, it's
definitely better than an explorer/mc-like file manager, but I still find it
less useful than a shell.  Some comments/notes:
- Operations on specific dir contents can be wildcard-globbed at open (and
  later).
- Can quickly sort a dir by date (though ls -tl is still better if that's all I
  want to do).
- OK for navigating a project dir full of files that I'm jumping around in
  (though ecb is probably better for this).
- C-_ works, but only for mark operations.
- C-x 4 d will open dired in another window
- Made a list of commands in ~/doc/dired_commands.txt
- It's possible to do a recursive display by setq-ing dired-listing-switches to

Evaluated.  Muse is a reasonably nice add-on that I'll keep around for times
when I might want to toss together a quick doc that I wanted multiple output
formats for.  Like, it might be great for documenting software or making
manuals.  However, I don't want to switch to it for general web publishing for
the following reasons:
- Instead of writing in HTML, I would have to write in a simplified wiki-like
  markup some of the time, and Muse would infer what markup I'd want the rest
  of the time based on things like indenting and such.
- Muse format offers reduced fine-grain control of output.
- I would still have to keep in mind what output markup Muse was going to
  convert anything to, which is just replacing one annoyance with another.
- I'd waste days rewriting existing pages into .muse files and tweaking them to
  generate the same output I already have.  In fact, generating that output
  just the way I want as it is now might not even be possible.
- Adds another layer of complexity to web publishing without enough return to
  justify it.  What if I'm outside of my trusty Emacs environment and just want
  to make a quick page edit with vi?
- Normal Emacs already grants me a lot of functionality for HTML editing that
  make it almost painless.  Thus, there's not really much of a problem to
  solve.
- Muse has its own ideas about dynamically generated content that might not
  match or become an obstacle to any CGI ideas I might have in the future.

Basic setup is in .emacs.  If I want to make a project for something, add code
like this:
(setq muse-project-alist
      '(("website" ("~/Pages" :default "index")
         (:base "html" :path "~/public_html")

Calc definitely isn't user-friendly (except maybe to forth and factor
programmers.)  It seems to make up for it in accessible math power once you get
over the rather large learning curve.  Having calc be second nature will be a
matter of using it for years, but now I have a hang of the basics and can
easily find additional functionality as needed.

Some great things I'll try to use calc for from now on:
- Verifying answers received from various programming book exercises.
- Datetime arithmetic, instead of writing programs that import date libs.
- Financial calculations, instead of hand-coding these in python or scheme.
- Calculations in org-mode tables.
- Will be handy for using when working on analytical math books.
- Various import (grab) commands.  Whenever I want to xfer data into calc I
  already have in a file, always look for an import function first.
- Matrix math for any future graphics programming or practicing linear algebra.
- Binary arithmetic like bit-wise operations, something I need to make more use
  of in C apps.  Also exports to LaTeX and other stuff too.
- It's possible to convert equations and solutions directly to C code.  Making
  use of this will save a ton of time whenever programming math in C (or other
  languages, since converting from C to most other languages is trivial).
- Lots more.  Basically, if it's analytical math-related, check here first.

Notes:
- Use h s to display a keymap and isearch for whatever I want.  In fact, h
  commands are pretty much a necessity given all the functionality calc has
  (some 750+ functions according to the keymap).
- Calc can output graph info to Gnuplot.  Probably no pressing need to set this
  up right now, but keep in mind if needed later.  Might be handy for graphing
  financial data at some point or as a graphing calculator replacement.

accurate info on how to integrate with Emacs (init-maxima broken), the elisp
files supposedly included in the port are missing, imaxima source build is
non-functional, and using from CLI memory leaks and segfaults sometimes.
Giving up on this app for now as a result.  Will stick with Emacs calc mainly

Notes:
- If a pipeline is preceded by `coproc', it is executed as a coprocess; a
  two-way pipe is established between it and the parent shell.  The shell can
  read from or write to the coprocess by means of the `&gt;&amp;p' and `&lt;&amp;p'
  redirection operators or with `print -p' and `read -p'.  A pipeline cannot be
  preceded by both `coproc' and `!'.  If job control is active, the coprocess
  can be treated in other than input and output as an ordinary background job.
- End coproc with `coproc exit'.

- w3m: This is also breaking newsticker.
- elscreen: No clue here.
- EMMS: Needs mplayer.
- gnuserv: Need to install this, but work machine will need to disable.

- gtags: Need GNU Global and a reference to gtags.el.
- run-scheme: REPL non-functional.  Apparently not fixable.

mingw mplayer and got EMMS working.  Absolute full integration isn't possible
obviously, and Windows will always be a second-best platform for the stuff I

Installed AUCTeX from ports (and apt-get on Linux), since it has a lot of deps
and an info file.  Also put MiKTeX and TeXniCenter on Windows.  It's possible
to get AUCTeX working on Windows, but it's a huge pain and not even remotely
worth the effort.

Read most of the AUCTeX info file, did some additional .emacs configuration for
it, worked through an online LaTeX tutorial ("Getting Started with LaTeX",
which was pretty good), created a practice file (latex_notes.tex), using the
book "Math Into LaTeX" as a reference for more complex mathematical notation. 

Notes:
- Compile with C-c C-c.  If there are errors, use C-c ` to view.  Keep using
  C-c ` to go to subsequent errors.
- To convert LaTeX to PDF, just run `latex file.tex' from CLI, or change output
  with pdflatex by toggling between DVI and PDF with C-c C-t C-p.
- AUCTeX has a massive number of keybindings.  Some of these, like C-c C-f,
  group a category of TeX tags.  Mashing a random key after the group prefix
  will show a list of completions.
- After compiling, look at the log to see if there were any style warnings, or
  use C-c C-w to toggle warnings on.
- See latexsheet.pdf for a quick reference of LaTeX commands.
- To preview within Emacs, use a preview command like preview-buffer (C-c C-p
  C-b).  When done looking at it, clear the preview with
  preview-clearout-buffer (C-c C-p C-c C-b).
- For looking up TeX characters, use C-h I or describe-input-method tex.

AUCTeX and LaTeX in general are quite amazing.  Should have mastered at least
LaTeX way back in undergrad.  Would have saved massive amounts of time wasted
struggling with retarded word processors like WordPerfect and MS Word.  Redo

Got HL-5240 postscript driver working with CUPS.  Steps documented here so I
know what to do next time.

Install notes:
- Install cups, cups-client, gutenprint (without gimp-print drivers), and
  foomatic-filters.
- Create /etc/devfs.rules with the following, which sets the permissions and
  associates print devices with the cups group:
  [system=10]
  add path 'unlpt*' mode 0660 group cups
  add path 'ulpt*' mode 0660 group cups
  add path 'lpt*' mode 0660 group cups
- Add root and other users to cups group in /etc/group
- Enable CUPS and the above rules at startup by adding these lines to
  /etc/rc.conf:
  cupsd_enable="YES"
  devfs_system_ruleset="system"
- In order to enable CUPS printing under certain Windows clients, the line
  below should be uncommented in /usr/local/etc/cups/mime.types and
  /usr/local/etc/cups/mime.convs:
  application/octet-stream
- Either reboot or issue the following commands:
  &gt; /etc/rc.d/devfs restart
  &gt; /usr/local/etc/rc.d/cupsd restart
- Config printers via the CUPS web interface by going to: <span class="org-link">http://localhost:631</span>
- Go to Administration|Add Printer, type in names, select USB printer 1,
  specify Brother-HL-5240-Postscript.ppd file from the local filesystem. Use
  root l/p when asked for a login.
- Set US Letter, no double siding, 600dpi, no banners.
- On Windows, just add a network printer (should find it automatically).
  Search for driver, install Brother HL-5420 BR-Script3.

GDB has a ton of features.  Research here is limited to getting many-windows
mode working in Emacs, and establishing a workflow for C/C++ debugging.  Used
<span class="org-link">http://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb_toc.html</span> as a reference.

An example debug session:
- Do gtags setup, load source file, hit &lt;F5&gt; and specify gcc or make with
  appropriate flags, including -g for debug symbols.
- Run M-x gdb against output file.
- Run M-x gdb-many-windows to flag many-windows as on.
- In gdb window, load symbols with `file &lt;output filename&gt;'.
- Use C-x &lt;SPACE&gt; in the source window to insert a breakpoint.  Alternatively,
  use `break &lt;function name&gt;' in GDB to set a breakpoint at a function entry
  point by name.
- In GDB, enter `r' to being running.  Include CLI parameters here if needed.
  Now the local vars, stack frames (same as `bt'), breakpoints, and other
  helpful info is visible.
- Use something like `set variable f = 0' or `p foo = 0' to evaluate
  expressions at runtime.
- Use `s' to step into, `n' to evaluate next in current scope.
- Use `c' to continue.
- Use `up' (C-x C-a &lt;) and `down' (C-x C-a &gt;) to navigate the call stack.
- Use M-x gdb-restore-windows if something munges the window layout.
- Check Gud menu for full list of commands.

Other actions:
- If compilation errors are encountered, use C-x ` to go to next error.
- Use M-! to execute the binary in normal mode and view output in a buffer.
- Start gdb with a core file with something like `gdb prog prog.core'.
- Attach GDB to a process with `gdb prog &lt;PID&gt;'.
- gdbserver can be used for remote debugging.

BibTeX is a better way to manage references within documents than just using
built-in LaTeX citations.  It also saves a ton of time by just grabbing the
BibTeX block for a cited work.  Read this and created a practice document using
external BibTeX references (bibtex_notes.tex):

<span class="org-link">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Bibliography_Management</span>

Notes:
- Including URLs in citations requires \usepackage{url} in the using document's
  preamble.
- Google Scholar is pretty handy for BibTeX searching for non-journal sources.
  Select "Show links to import citations into BibTeX" in Scholar Preferences.
  For non-scientific papers, CiteULike seems decent.

Added the following to /etc/rc.conf:
powerd_enable="YES"
powerd_flags="-i 85 -r 60 -p 100"

Previously:
dev.cpu.0.freq: 2333

With scaling:
dev.cpu.0.freq: 750

Costs about 1MB of resident memory to run powerd, but should save around 50% of
the power used by the CPU.  Also lowers the running temperature to around 28C.
Ran naive Fibonacci in Lisp with a large n and confirmed the CPU does scale up
to max as needed.

Update: Not using this on new workstation, since the Atom n270 already only
uses 4W while pegged.  Thus, the (idle clock cycles saved) - (cycles consumed
by powerd polling) would end up with a minuscule net benefit.

Get this working with wl.  Being paranoid already, encrypting all my email
should fit into my lifestyle well.  Requires MailCrypt.

<span class="org-link">http://box.matto.nl/wanderlustgpg.html</span>

Also use this to encrypt all archived data. Check out this (also requires
MailCrypt) to work with .gpg files:

<span class="org-link">http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/mc-gpg-file-mode.el</span>

Finally, go through ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf and take a look at all the options or
consult manual for choosing desired settings.

Update: Canceling above tasks for now, since the FreeBSD ports version of
MailCrypt deps Emacs 21.3 and it doesn't look like anyone is going to fix that
anytime soon.  In the meantime, got GPG working from the shell, which is
slightly less convenient than editing encrypted files in place.

NOTES:
- GPG CLI requires pinentry.  On FreeBSD, this comes in various flavors, and
  curses mode is the least annoying.  Install ports/security/pinentry-curses.
- To encrypt files into binary goo, use `gpg -c filename'.
- To encrypt files into ASCII, use `gpg -c -a filename'.
- To decrypt files, use `gpg -o outfile infile.gpg'.  By default, the outfile
  created during encryption retains its original filename and is appended with
  .gpg or .asc.  This works on both encryption output types.

On the recommendation of the DBA at work, did a half-assed investigation of

2005 Administrator's Companion".  See comments on book above.

The underlying technologies of SSIS, SSAS, and SSRS (from what I can tell) are
lame and boring, only good if you're a mindless corporate drone with mortgage
bills to pay.  These are basically just data transfer/analysis/reporting
methods that have their details abstracted away from you in a CMS-like manner.

Will need to revisit ASDF later for making my own build systems.  This task is
just on the end-user side for now.  ASDF is already included in SBCL.

asdf-install: <span class="org-link">http://www.cliki.net/ASDF-Install</span>
mk-defsystem: <span class="org-link">http://www.cliki.net/mk-defsystem</span>

asdf-install notes:
- Install: (asdf-install:install 'vecto)
- Load a package already installed: (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :vecto), or in SBCL
  just: (require :vecto)
- To asdf-install while ignoring security, add this to /.asdf-install:
  (defparameter ASDF-INSTALL-CUSTOMIZE::*VERIFY-GPG-SIGNATURES* nil)
- Otherwise, grab the developer's public key off their site and add it to the
  gpg public keyring with: gpg --import pubkey.asc
- List of asdf-installable pkgs on asdf-install CLiki site.
- asdf:*CENTRAL-REGISTRY* stores location of local registry.  Currently mapped
  to ~/.sbcl/asdf-registry.
- See ~/.sbcl/systems for a list of installed packages.  Multiple versions
  defsystem in the same .asd file and correspond to different sub-directories
  in ~/.sbcl/site.
- Use M-x slime-apropos-package to list all external symbols in a package.
- Use an installed and loaded package: (use-package :vecto)
- Additional asdf-upgrade package can keep packages up to date.  Doing this
  manually for now.

mk-defsystem notes:
- Can install mk-defsystem via ASDF, which saves some manual labor.
- Modify .sbclrc (see file for contents).
- Grab tarball of system to install, and extract it in ~/cl-library.
- Symlink the .system file to the cl-library parent directory, with something
  like `ln -s ~/cl-library/cl-ppcre-0.4.0/cl-ppcre.system
  ~/cl-library/cl-ppcre.system'.
- Start up SBCL and load with: (mk:find-system :cl-ppcre)
- Then compile with: (mk:oos :cl-ppcre :compile)
- Then load with: (mk:oos :cl-ppcre :load)

asdf-install is considerably more advanced and less error-prone than
mk-defsystem, so use that when possible.  XCVB is an in-development potential
replacement for ASDF, but ASDF is still the current standard.

Installed this just to compare commercial Lisp IDEs to Emacs+SLIME.  Probably
won't use this for anything, but this and Allegro CL are semi-popular in
industry.  Only checked out the Windows port, but there's one for Linux and
FreeBSD as well.

Some brief observations after writing some code in it:
- Fonts are not anti-aliased, so they all look like ass.  Only fixedsys is
  reasonably bearable and looking at that all day would get old fast.
- Has some nice tools easily accessible, like: various browsers, a shell window,
  multiple listeners, tracer, profiler, metadata breakpoints.
- Compilation output gives some useful code metrics, something I haven't seen a
  free implementation do.
- Has some Emacs keybindings, but still have to use the mouse for a lot of
  stuff, especially managing all the MDI windows.
- Doesn't auto-format code like Emacs and syntax-highlighting isn't as nice.
- Be sure not to leave any unsaved code open in LispWorks overnight, since this
  edition shuts down automatically after 5 hours.

I prefer my current Emacs+SLIME setup for the kind of Lisping I do by a large
margin, but since LispWorks supports a lot of enterprise-grade features and
doesn't require weeks of tweaking or the memorization of thousands of key
sequences, it can make sense in a commercial setting.

more, grab a couple of 32GB or 64GB drives and use one for backup and one for

msdosfs, assuming I won't need to mount them outside of FreeBSD.

Since FF2 on FreeBSD is now unsupported with open security holes and FF3 is
unacceptably bloated, switching to Conkeror for a GUI web client.  I'll miss
Vimperator, but after the initial setup, Conkeror is better overall (uses Emacs
keybindings, fewer package dependencies, easier to migrate config, etc).

Notes:
- Post-install setup: Reads .conkerorrc on FreeBSD, but on Windows, the %HOME%
  environmental variable isn't read.  So, put rc file somewhere and run: M-:
  user_pref("conkeror.rcfile", "c:\\path\\to\\conkerorrc");
- Adblock Plus:
  - Grab Adblock Plus xpi from adblockplus.org.
  - Run M-x extensions and install the xpi manually.  
  - Then restart, go to the extension's options and add a filter subscription.
- Customized "blackened" theme:
  - Put a copy in ~/.conkeror.mozdev.org/blackened on FreeBSD and
    C:\bm3719\bin\conkeror\style\blackened on Windows.
  - Edit minibuffer.css and change background-color of minibuffer element to
    AAA and color to black.  The default scheme makes input text unreadable.
  - Archived a tarball of this to ~/doc/misc/blackened.tar.
- Webjumps by default are a bit of a mess:
  - In define_default_webjumps in /usr/local/share/conkeror/modules/webjump.js,
    comment out all except scholar, dictionary, clhs, emacswiki, cliki.
  - In /usr/local/share/conkeror/search-engines, delete answers,
    creativecommons, mozilla-bugzilla, yahoo.  Doing this requires going into
    modules/search-engine.js and commenting out the retarded static defines.
  - Can type the minimally-distinct substring of webjump instead of full name.
  - Added Amazon, Google Finance, Hoogle, FreeBSD Ports webjumps to rc.
- Created rc file with lots more custom stuff.  Edit this when moving between
  systems since it has a static pathname for the theme/start page, and there's
  no function to check the OS type.  Apart from that, should be fully portable.
- Some non-Emacs-based commands:
  - C-x C-v or G: Edit existing URL.
  - M-w: Copy selected text.
  - [nime*][sc]: Save/copy link/image/frame/media/DOM prefix (0 for current
    page).  See content-buffer/element.js for full list.
  - C-i: Calls edit-current-field-in-external-editor when on a textfield.
  - M-x view-source: Open source in $EDITOR.
  - See full bindings in modules/bindings/defaults.
- In minibuffer.prototype.read_yes_or_n in modules/minibuffer-read-option.js,
  add "y" and "n" the options array and an or-conditional for result == "y".
  This fixes the whole typing "yes" and "no" thing on download overwrites.
- Bookmarks: Just using lynx bookmarks as a start page for now.  Revisit this
  later if Conkeror gets additional bookmark support.
- Maybe add password management later, but probably shouldn't since xulrunner
  stores these in a text file.

Update: Adding MozRepl installation.
- Grab mozrepl.xpi from <span class="org-link">http://repo.hyperstruct.net/mozrepl/</span> and install with
  M-x extensions.
- Added config to .conkerorrc.  Make sure it's there.
- Run M-: user_pref('extensions.mozrepl.autoStart', true);
- Make sure that .mozrepl.js is in ~.
- Restart Conkeror.

Generally, I think portupgrade is a better management utility than portmanager
when having a ton of installed ports, but since mine tends to be around 350 or
so, portmanager is almost as useful and doesn't require a Ruby backend.  Also
can detect pkgs built with stale deps.  It does get slower proportional to
number of ports installed, since it has to recollect port info every time.

Examples:
- List outdated ports: portmanager -s | grep OLD
- Full upgrade with logging: portmanager -u -l
- Upgrades everything except nedit,open office and their dependencies:
  portmanager -u -ip editors/nedit editors/openoffice
- Upgrade gnome2 and its dependencies with logging enabled: portmanager
  x11/gnome2 -l
- Rebuild gnome2 and its dependencies: portmanager x11/gnome2 -l -f
- Show leaf ports (ports without dependencies upon them): portmanager -sl

document the commands so I can blindly run them when needed.  Need to buy some
blank CDs first.

Update: Canceling this and uninstalling these apps for the following reasons:
- Haven't created an audio CD in like 8 years and can't imagine wanting to.
- No longer backing up data to DVDs.

Been staring at misc-fixed on BSD and Courier New on Windows for the last 12
years or more.  Updating fonts worked pretty well on Windows, but it looks like
decent fonts support is still pretty lame on Unix-variants, at least in the
apps I use.

Inconsolata on FreeBSD:
- Install x11-fonts/inconsolata-ttf (called ttf-inconsolata on Linux).
- Add `/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/OTF/' to the FontPath in xorg.conf.
- Run mkfontdir and mkfontscale in the OTF directory if the fonts don't already
  show up in the fonts.dir and fonts.scale files.
- Add a `xset fp+ /usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/OTF' to .xinitrc.
- Check xfontsel to see if inconsolata shows up (restart X or do a xrdb -merge
  .Xdefaults).
- Enabled for gvim, but Emacs doesn't support anti-aliased fonts in 22.3.  Will
  have to wait until 23.1 is out.  Tried in urxvt, but too blurry for me.

Terminus on FreeBSD:
- Using in Emacs and urxvt.
- Useful for monospace Unicode support.
- Add /usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/terminus-font to FontPath in xorg.conf.

Code2000 on FreeBSD:
- Picks up everything else missed by the above.
- Conkeror includes this as a backup font in most obscure Unicode ranges.

Consolas on Windows: 
- Archived a copy of Consolas in C:\bm3719\doc\fonts.
- Be sure to activate ClearType or it'll look like aliased crap.  
- Need to install fonts on Windows 2k8 via Control Panel|Fonts.
- Using in w32 Emacs, MSVS, gvim, PuTTY, and SecureCRT.

Instead of trying to remember which make flags I prefer on each port, then
manually typing in each -DWITH_SOME_FLAG argument, created a collection of
system-wide make settings to manage these.

Example:
- Edit /etc/make.conf to include the following:
  .if ${.CURDIR:M*/usr/ports*}
  .include "/etc/ports.conf"
  .endif
- Create/edit /etc/ports.conf, adding entries like this:
  .if ${.CURDIR:M*/www/apache*}
  WITH_OPENSSL_BASE=1
  APACHE_BUFFERED_LOGS=1
  .endif
- This example effectively adds -DWITH_OPENSSL_BASE -DAPACHE_BUFFERED_LOGS when

- Edit /usr/local/etc/lighttpd.conf, enable mod_fastcgi, mod_userdir, and
  mod_cgi along with their corresponding sections.  See current conf file for
  the full changes.
- If starting from CLI, use `/usr/local/etc/rc.d/lighttpd start'.
- Requires properly owned error and access logfiles, so run:
  cd /var/log; touch lighttpd.error.log; chown www:www lighttpd.error.log;
  touch lighttpd.access.log; chown www:www lighttpd.access.log;
- mod_fastcgi requires `mkdir /var/run/lighttpd; chown www:www
  /var/run/lighttpd;'.
- Updated ~/bin/logcheck script.
- For PHP support, recompile lang/php5 with FastCGI extensions and set php-cgi
  binary to fastcgi.server's bin-path.

Memory footprint much smaller than with Apache 1.3.x.x.  Later on, check out
Haskell/Lisp mods, setup/install darcs_cgi, find a replacement for mimeTeX
which deps Apache (maybe just do this manually with www/textogif).

watt-meter to confirm.  Should be able to stick with this exact hardware until
i386 is abandoned by most developers.

Hardware used:
- Intel D945GSEJT m-ITX motherboard ($109).
- OCZ Vertex Series OCZSSD2-1VTX30G SSD ($165).
- SUPER TALENT 2GB 200-Pin DDR2 SO-DIMM DDR2 800 RAM ($47).
- Morex T-1610 case ($65)

Observations:
- Can't use VESA mount with Dell monitors, so using the vertical stand.
- The power switch doesn't lock in the on position, and should have probably
  been a button instead.  Still works fine though.
- Would be nice to have a front USB port for thumb drives.
- Front power LED on my case is non-functional.
- Apart from all of that, works great and is completely silent.

Instead of source upgrading as normal, started over from scratch since it's a
new disk.  Sticking with i386 version since the Atom N270 is a single-core,
32-bit instruction set CPU.

Notes:
- FreeBSD 8 now distributes a USB drive image, so using that.
- Managed to cut down my installed packages by about 50.
- Documented process in fbsd_setup.org to make future installs easier.
- Would have hoped Emacs 23 was out of -devel by now, but didn't make it in
  time, so will stick with 22.3 for now.
- Using cabal to only install stuff at the per-user level.
- All development environments configured and fully operational.
- Xorg actually runs smoother with this crappy integrated 945GME, probably due
  to Intel driver being better than the nv one.
- Generic kernel: 11492703, custom kernel: 6688090.
- Boots pretty fast, and with network services running, uses about 20MB active
  memory.  
- Fixed all setup mistakes made last time around.

Basically this is about as perfect a setup as I can imagine.  Shouldn't need to
upgrade any of these parts for many years.

Looks like git is winning the repo game, so probably should learn how to
interact with it in Emacs.  Took a survey of Emacs git interfaces to find one
that works and sucks not.

Notes:
- Was going to install Magit, but `make install' barfs. Egg is a Magit fork, so
  using that instead.
- Run u_egg update script and M-x byte-compile-file egg.el.
- Opening a file in a git-managed directory (where .git exists, I guess)
  auto-loads Egg in minor-mode.
- Prefixes git commands with C-x v.  E.g. C-x v l shows branch history.

This works pretty good.  No complaints so far.

2k8r2 is still better than Windows 7, but it's a big step on the path to
further n00bification.  All the more reason to leave the Windows box off, I
guess.

Observations:
- Removes classic start menu.  There's an add-on hack to replace it, but it's
  not really the same.  At least classic taskbar is still here.
- Dragging windows for tiling 2 apps is nice, but requires too much mouse
  molesting to be really useful.
- Wastes much more RAM than 2k8 did.  To what end, I cannot tell.

Tasks Completed:
- Installed OS and de-fagified default system settings some.
- Installed MSVS 2010 RC-something.
- Installed some apps, games, utils.  Going to try to lazy-load these, so I
  don't waste days installing stuff I'll never use.
- Setup Emacs and printing.
- Setup IIS backup site.
- Tried to install MS SQL Server, but it barfed.  Don't need this now, and
  since r2 is coming out, will try again later when I need it.
- Setup Cygwin (base, urxvt, Xorg, some fonts, git, svn, etc).

If I knew r2 was going to be the way it turned out to be, I'd not have
bothered.  But, it's not worth downgrading.  I think I stopped caring.

Valgrind is the current de facto standard for a memory profiler.  No pressing
need for this, since I'm not writing any C, so just spending a few hours
getting aware of its benefits here.

Notes:
- Requires a procfs entry in /etc/fstab, like `proc /proc procfs rw 0 0'.
  Then `mount proc'.
- Created a test file ~/src/c/valgrind_test.c.
- After compiling, run valgrind on the output with something like this:
  valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=yes --show-reachable=yes
  --num-callers=20 --track-fds=yes ./valgrind_test
- This catches the forgetting to free chars from the first and last malloc.
  There's many other kinds of errors that can be caught.  Check Valgrind manual
  for explanations of those.

Valgrind's quite great, and I'll definitely use it on all C programs larger
than a few 100 lines from now on.  Maybe check out gprof (performance analysis)
and splint (security profiling) in the future.

Replaced Frotz with this Emacs major mode.

Update: After playing a lot of IF on Malyon, I've concluded it's pretty good,
but only most of the time.  There are some major downsides to it:
- It only supports 3 Z machine formats.  Even zblorb doesn't work.
- It sometimes doesn't capture certain keys, thinking they are Emacs commands.
- Killing game buffers in some cases doesn't properly exit the mode.  There's
  then no way to start a new game without restarting Emacs.
- Some games, like Lost Pig, have a lag when parsing input.

These are pretty bad, but for games that actually work in it, this mode is
fine, and being in Emacs is of course a big plus.  So, I'll use it in those
cases, but it looks like I'll have to reinstall Frotz for everything else.

The main purpose for bothering to keep this Thinkpad up to date is that it's
useful for testing out new applications or configurations without gunking up my
main box.

Do the same setup as workstation except the following differences:
- Reduce size of /home and /var in disk setup.
- Enable APM in post-install configuration.
- Don't install mysql-server, ddclient, lighttpd/fastcgi.
- Don't setup a printer or bother with cups-client.
- Different symlinks.
- Don't bother setting up a local samba share (just using samba client).
- Leave netsmb_load out of loader.conf and nmbd/smbd out of rc.conf.
- Since I'm updating to 9.0-CURRENT (for no particular reason), use `tag=.' in
  src-supfile.
- Enable ACPI support for the various extra Thinkpad buttons in kernel config.

Kernel errors do seem to occur occasionally on -CURRENT.  Since I'm not doing
any OS development, probably better off sticking with -RELEASE in the future.

Emacs' wl is an okay MUA, but mutt provides all the same features and more, and
does so far faster.  While perhaps not the final word on mail clients for me,
mutt is definitely a small overall improvement for this task in my case or at
least seems so at the moment.  Uninstalling wl and will try to use this
exclusively for a few months.

Setup notes: 
- Looks like some options I'd rather use (like message and header caching) are
  not supported in the version I'm using.  Could try mutt-devel or just check
  back after some time to see if they or some equivalent has been added.
- Not a big deal, but Gmail trash folders are non-functional.  To get this
  working, apply the trash patch for current mutt version from
  <span class="org-link">http://cedricduval.free.fr/mutt/patches/download.html</span> and recompile.
- Need msmtp port for an SMTP MTA.  Be sure to compile with -DWITH_GNUTLS
  (added to /etc/ports.conf).
- Create a symlink to <span class="italic">/usr/local/share/certs/ca-root.crt as /etc/ssl/cert.pem,
  or cp the file to ~/</span>.mutt/cert.pem (did the latter).
- Created a ~/.msmtprc file, chmoded 0600.
- Created a ~/.muttrc file and ~/.mutt directory.
- Using Emacs as message editor, but not pager.
- Considered setting up print/muttprint, but since it only takes a couple more
  seconds to save the message to a file and print that, and considering I can't
  even remember the last time I wanted to print an email, I'm skipping it.

Most used keybindings:
- m: compose message
- d: delete current message
- v: view attachments
- a: attach file
- y: send message
- ?: shows all commands in current context
- ^: update IMAP inbox (custom key)
- c: change folder

Some day when I have nothing better to do, consider setting up the whole mail
stack (current setup + fetchmail and procmail), just using Gmail for a mail
relay.  This exceeds my current interest in email right now though.  See this

This task was just to get a main theorem prover environment working.  Will be
sticking Agda for now, as both Coq and Isabelle (which require Proof General)
pull in a lot of dependencies.  Agda seems capable of everything the others
are, for the most part, and is more entrenched in the Haskell world, so will
default to this for now until there's reason to do otherwise.

Agda: Written in Haskell and available on Hackage.  No Proof General support,
but has its own Emacs major mode.  In addition to a proof assistant, Agda is
also its own dependently typed functional language.
- In order to get the CLI Agda batch mode binary, install with `cabal install
  Agda-executable -p'.
- A dependency of this is haskeline, which for some reason can't find libiconv.
  Specifying its location manually with `cabal install haskeline -p
  --extra-lib-dirs=/usr/local/lib' worked though.
- Added Agda hook to .emacs.  agda-mode starts when loading a .agda file.
- Will need to read up some on Martin-L&#246;f Type theory.
- An Agda "standard library" exists that includes various modules full of
  common functionality.  Requires a source install.
- A lot of the documentation online refers to Agda 1, which uses a completely
  different syntax and system architecture, so always check that first.

Notes on other software for future consideration:

Coq: Seems to be the most popular system, but is very bloaty. Compiling this on
FreeBSD with WITH_IDE="no" avoids pulling in the mess of Gnome libs it depends
on by default, but the Proof General issues prevent me from this being as
usable as Agda.  Assuming I resolve this later, read the Coq tutorial and then:
<span class="org-link">http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/</span>

Isabelle: Probably most useful for FOL/HOL and ZFC set theory.  But, from what
I can tell doesn't do anything that Agda can't do except export to a few other
languages.  Written in SML, and seems to have a build option for running with
SML/NJ (which I already use) instead of PolyML.  Also has Proof General
support.

Proof General: FreeBSD port of this doesn't detect GNU Emacs install properly
and tries to install XEmacs.  Setting the supposed make flags to their
indicated values has no effect.  Also requires bash for some stupid reason.

Still in need of a plotting CAS for some upcoming calculus work that I'd prefer
not to need Windows for.  Try installing various apps on the laptop and pick
the least annoying and preferably one without a very app-specific language.
Ideally, it'd have an Emacs interface with output to Gnuplot or something
similar, but I won't rule out TeXmacs or custom "notebook" UIs.  Also need to
be able to dump anything written here into LaTeX, which would save a rewriting
stuff twice.

Some options: Octave (uses MatLab notation), Maxima (written in Lisp, but
already tried this on GNU/Linux and wouldn't integrate with Emacs there), Yacas
(not high on the list, since it uses its own language along with the XML-based
OpenMath), OpenAxiom (no comments so far), Mathomatic (no plotting, so not
really a solution, but might have use for it anyway), MathEclipse (does
everything needed at the moment, but Eclipse is for fags).

Maxima: Brings in gnuplot (default options OK for this).  Seems to work pretty
good.  Running something like `plot2d(x^2-x+3, [x,-10,10]);' does draw the
graph properly in gnuplot.  Will be sticking with this then until there's
reason to do otherwise.

Handles a large number of lightweight image manipulation tasks from the command
line.  Nothing complicated about it.  Might be able to incorporate this for
certain repetitive actions, like resizing images.  Obviously, this doesn't
replace the rare need for a full-featured graphical suite, but should take care
of 90% of my image tasks, which is already an uncommon thing anyway.

I'm not going to try to predict all future image manipulation tasks.  Just add
notes here when I figure out some handy operation to use this for.  The
ImageMagick homepage or Google usually turns up an answer.

Notes:
- Install with defaults, minus FPX and JBIG support.  If I want SVG support,
  enable that here (this depends on librsvg, for which Mozilla plugin support
  should be disabled).  Enabling SVG pulls in a lot of other dependencies too,
  so only enable if really needed.  Compiling without it for now.
- Use display command to view images.
- To create a negative of an image, use `convert -negate pos.png neg.png'.

Now that I've gotten Maxima actually working, I need to spend a couple days
learning it before doing any analytical calculus work.  Did some of the
tutorials on <span class="org-link">http://maxima.sourceforge.net/documentation.html</span> and created a
test LaTeX document in ~/src/latex/maxima. The manual at
<span class="org-link">http://maxima.sourceforge.net/docs/manual/en/maxima.html</span> also has per-math
topic sections.

Notes:
- Use `? functionname' to view documentation on any function.
- To output to PNG, use something like this example: 
  plot3d(f(x,y), [x,-5,5], [y,-5,5], [nticks, 500], 
  [gnuplot_term, "png size 1000 1000"], [gnuplot_out_file, "myfile.png"]);
- Use trunc() when plotting infinite series.
- gnuplot can also be used on its own and has a bunch of potentially useful
  features including an add-on Emacs mode.  Might want to check this out
  sometime later.
- Functions like lambda(), map(), apply() have their same meanings as in Lisp.
- Also as in Lisp, quoted expressions with the ' char are not evaluated.
- Can export a file with something like save("filename.max", all); which stores
  the current session buffer as Lisp expressions.  load() does the opposite.
  writefile() can be used to enable logging for a session.
- . is used for scalar product (the dot product of two vectors or matrices).
- When using something like diff(), del(var) will be returned in the
  differential if var is not specified.  If needing to get rid of this, set
  del(x) to 1 with `%, del(x) = 1'.
- imaxima seems nonfunctional on FreeBSD and GNU/Linux.  According to some
  docs, this was the GUI frontend, but xmaxima seems to work.
- If doing work I want to save, open a .max file and use the maxima buffer as a
  REPL, sending lines or regions to be evaluated.  This is probably the best
  way to do series of exercises in a textbook.

Maxima -&gt; LaTeX workflow:
- Use the tex() function to output TeX formatted markup for any expression.
- Paste the generated TeX into my LaTeX document.  I prefer numbered equations,
  usually, so if I want that, change the $$ pairs to \begin{equation} and
  \end{equation} tags.

Maxima -&gt; LaTeX -&gt; HTML workflow (using latex2html):
- Duplicate above workflow until the LaTeX form is complete.
- Run latex2html on the filename.tex file, generating a filename directory
  with the HTML files and images in PNG form.
- Note that these usually won't be chmoded correctly due to my umask.
- Also note that this creates a page for each subsection.  Flag with
  `-no_navigation -split 0' for a single page, which is probably what I'll want
  most of the time.
- Note this creates an index.html in a directory, but the links point to
  anchors within filename.html.  If doing some manual formatting afterward,
  only use the latter, preferably.

An alternative method to the above is to paste in the equation TeX markup into
EQ tags in a pre-existing HTML document and run gladtex on that.  This probably
makes more sense for appending some equations to an already existing document.

I've learned how to use xargs several times in the past.  It's not complicated,
but I always forget by the time I need it next.  Recorded relearning it here so
it can be the last time.

- A simple example to rm a bunch of files, one a time with prompting.
  find . -maxdepth 1 -name '*.txt' | xargs -p -n1 rm
- This version handles names with whitespace.
  find . -maxdepth 1 -name '*.txt' -print0 | xargs -p -n1 -0 rm
- Input manipulation.  This creates a backup of all .png files in cwd.
  find . -maxdepth 1 -name '*.png' | xargs -p -n1 -I {} cp {} {}.bak

Notes:
- -t echoes the command before executing it, and -p echoes it and asks for
  confirmation.
- -n1 passes one argument at a time to the command -- usually what I want.
- The whitespace handling args are required on both sides of the pipe to work.

Darcs is losing the repo wars badly to git.  I still like it for various
reasons and will use it locally to manage all projects not already under some
other VCS.  Been using it for a few years now, but this is a directed effort to
become familiar with all things Darcs and incorporate it into everyday life.

Reasons why Darcs is better than git:
- Certain unusual tasks (e.g. modifying previous patches so they appear atomic)
  are doable without a complex workflow.
- Darcs is based on a "theory of patches", which allows for any supported
  operation to be provable within it.  This, IMO, is how complex software
  should be designed.  Git, on the other hand, uses the standard "just get it
  working" model, like most Linux apps.
- Darcs is written in Haskell, and with all things being equal, I'd rather
  install apps that I enjoy looking at the source code for.

To create a repo:
- Go to directory where repo is to be created and run `darcs initialize'.
- Now run `darcs add dir1 dir2 file1 ...' to add all files and dirs.  Probably
  want to run `darcs add * -r' though to recursively add everything.
- If this includes "boring" files by Darcs' definition, and I want these, use
  --boring flag.
- Record the first patch (which is everything) with `darcs record --all'.

Grabbing a repo:
- Over HTTP: darcs get <span class="org-link">http://somewhere.org/darcs/project</span>
- Over SSH: darcs get bm3719@cellblock:/home/bm3719/repo/project
- Grab the latest from upstream with `darcs pull'.

Using Darcs:
- After changing some stuff, run `darcs whatsnew' to see pending changes.  Note
  this won't pick up added files.  Run `darcs whatsnew -l' for that.
- When ready, run `darcs record' to create a patch, including various changes.
  Try to keep these atomic to a single feature, bugfix, project, or whatever.
- If this is non-central repo, use `darcs send -a' to send all patches upstream
  by email, and if a local mail client isn't functional, export to a file with
  `darcs send -a --output=~/changes.patch' and email them manually.
- Over SSH, use `darcs push bm3719@cellblock:/home/bm3719/repo/project'
- Create a tag for current set of patches with `darcs tag'.

Other notes:
- Might want to check out darcsweb at: <span class="org-link">http://blitiri.com.ar/p/darcsweb/</span>
- The CAMP project is mildly interesting: <span class="org-link">http://projects.haskell.org/camp/</span>
- Created a Darcs repo in ~/src/repo to store all files I want to version
  control.  Right now this is just what was currently in ~/public_html/src plus
  a few other things I have laying around.
- Added some environmental variables for Darcs to .zshrc.
- Switched from vc-darcs to darcsum in Emacs.  Deferred to separate task.
- Note that umask affects the permissions of the patches created.  Make sure
  they're all chmoded a+r.
- Might wanna think about setting up per-project repos, instead of having one
  big one.

important tasks.  Will schedule this later when I foresee the free time for it.

Notes:
- Added ruby-mode support to ~/.emacs, including run-ruby mode.
- If doing some Rails at a later date, add additional Emacs support for that.

Having set up Ruby and gems, I then proceeded to browse RubyForge for fine
additions to either my general or Ruby-specific environment, but was rather
disappointed.  If "Rails is a Ghetto," then the rest of the Ruby world is its
sewer.  Surely there are some projects of worth here, but thus far, their
presence eludes me.

Already knew these, but needed to internalize them.

Notes:
- Object Initializers: Include these when instantiating new objects; e.g. new
  MyObj() { prop1 = "val" }
- Collection Initializers: Use if an object implements IEnumerable and defines
  Add(); e.g. MyCol col = new MyCol { 3, 4 }; // calls Add() on 3 and 4
- Anonymous types: Saves some explicit type defining for simple collections of
  properties.  Like a struct, but less verbose; e.g. var x = new { FirstName =
  "John", LastName = "Doe" };
- Local type inference: Saves some type declaration.  Not a big deal.  Probably
  was added mainly for LINQ; e.g. var x = new List&lt;int&gt;();
- Lambda Expressions: Just like in other languages.  Use instead of anonymous
  delegates; e.g. listOfFoo.Where(x =&gt; x.Size &gt; 10);
- Expression trees: Deferring to an in-depth LINQ study.
- Automatic properties: Typing saving syntactic sugar; e.g. public string Name
  { get; private set; }
- Extension methods: Static method that extends another class's existing
  method.  Requires a `this' keyword in parameter.  Doesn't belong in an OOP
  language, IMO.
- Partial methods: Pretty much a useless feature unless you really wanted a
  partial class with all the method type signatures in it like a C header file.

This is probably a non-optimal use of time, but might as well waste a few days
skimming this.  Could learn a few things to make work life easier at least.
Ignore anything VSTO, VB, or JScript-related. Only read this stuff while at
work.  In particular, look into all the extra debugging functionality.  I was
originally going to buy the book 'Advanced Windows Debugging', but I have a
feeling all the info is already here for free.

Update: Read a lot of the intro documentation, but this started getting into
reference-level detail.  So, calling off any further effort here.  Will
probably still randomly read pages to kill time at work now and then though.

Reviewed the notes I took from Devconnections (in ~/conference.txt) to see if
there's anything worth committing to long term memory.

Thoughts (per talk):
- .Net Rocks session: Noted the morbid obesity of hosts.  Interviewed some
  boring ASP.Net guy who said nothing of importance.  Noticed that anyone that
  includes stuff like "MVP, MCSD, MSDE" after their name is probably a
  quiche-eating homo.
- TFS VC talk: Boring.
- VS2010 &amp; 2k8 GDR talk: Check out "Database projects", unit test coverage
  tool, and pcode profiling once 2010 is out.
- WPF &amp; WCF in business apps: Meh.
- LINQ talk: OK for an overview, but nothing I didn't already know.
- Reflection talk: Can discover type info, late binding, and attributes set.
  Can be used to combine modules in different languages into one assembly
  (requires CLI tool).  ReflectionPermission can block reflection.  Attributes
  can be applied to assemblies, classes, members, and parameters.
- .Net Synchronization: Asynchronous delegate pattern.  Uses thread marshaling
  and BackgroundWorker.  Task Parallel Library is an API that provides thread
  pooling and other such stuff.  PLINQ parallelizes LINQ (which is coming out
  soon).
- Expression Blend demo: Yawn.
- Transactions for the Common Service: Probably the most interesting talk I
  attended.  Some code samples on CD if this problem ever comes up in real
  life, but it's still interesting from a theoretical perspective.  This is
  basically the underlying problem of distributed state.  Some active research
  here in volatile resource managers (normal ones non-viable for this problem),
  durable services, and durable behavior.

Maybe I just picked crappy talks to attend, but most of these sucked.
Definitely wouldn't go to MS conferences if I was the one paying for it.  Could
have learned far more just staying home and reading for 5 days.  Probably won't
even bother taking notes at these from now on.

Doing a full saga run with an evil bard (skald) and a 4 character party (PC,
Viconia, Imoen, Edwin).

Update: Spanked Molahey and confronted Tranzig on Feldepost's Inn 2F.  Game
then crashed after zoning out of the map, corrupting the install, and is now
unrecoverable.  Will try again some day with the updated BGTutu version and
a new char. :(

Notes for next time (if doing a similar run):
- Make male bard instead of female to get Viconia romance in BG2.
- Try to roll these stats: STR 18 (Viconia needs gauntlets of ogre power), DEX
  17, CON 16 (max HP bonus for bards), INT 17 (max INT not necessary at
  beginning, but will max later with tome), WIS 9 (only affects lore, which
  bards have in abundance), CHA 18 (add tome + char cloak for 21, which makes
  up for the low rep some).  Total: 95.
- Put proficiencies in long sword, two weapon, and short sword.

Installed this instead of legacy Star Control II, which it's a considerable
improvement on.  However, it's also a frustrating game for the following
reasons:
- Combat is too arcade-like and has horribly awkward controls.
- Navigation around systems is too imprecise.
- Planet surface activity plays like a cheap mini-game.

Still a pretty good game, considering.  But, too much button-mashing and too
little thinking for my tastes.

Best tower game played so far.  Almost perfect.  Keeping this one installed for
occasional replaying.

Complaints:
- 20 maps for a full-featured game seems a bit low.
- Opening tower placement too important compared to later placement.  There's
  usually only one or two proper opening moves.
- Most maps could use another 5-10 waves.
- Grinder mode needs more variety.

Pretty good tower/RTS game.  Not quite good enough to keep around after doing
everything though.

Complaints:
- Only having surface mining is a little unrealistic.
- Could use more building types, upgrade options, or something to add more
  strategy variety.
- Having no way to create terrain funnels vastly limits strategic options.
- Really needs more precise building placement controls, especially considering
  that's what the game is mostly about.
- Needs ability to adjust threat timer.

Playing through as a mage.  Overall, this is an OK game, but I do have many
design complaints, mostly having to do with over-simplification of various
gameplay elements.

The good: 
- Great graphics and a much better camera system than NWN.
- An all new game universe, with lots of new lore to learn.
- Manages to present some decent strategic challenges.

The bad:
- Overdoes it on the blood splattering everywhere.
- Highly influenced by MMORPG-style spell/ability systems.  There's a lot I
  dislike about this, but generally it's just dumbed down compared to D&amp;D.
- Too few items, spells, enemy types, races, classes, etc.
- No place to store items not currently needed besides selling them to the shop
  and having to buy back later at a huge markup.
- Enemies don't drop all of the items that they were using, e.g. kill a knight
  wearing full plate wielding two swords and he drops only a heal potion.
- Some annoying graphical oversights, like character model clipping, invisible
  walls, and randomly disappearing sustained spell effects.
- Plot largely linear despite the occasional choice of sequence.  No
  opportunity for the player to do any higher thinking to put pieces together.
- Despite the visually detailed background, interaction with it is limited to
  the rare predetermined container or activation object.
- Long load times no matter how good your hardware is.
- Like most modern MMORPGs, requires a con system of colored mob names to
  indicate difficulty.  Better design negates the need for this, like having
  difficult mobs be the ones that look fearsome.
- Has a few original parts, but most of the story is pretty clich&#233;, filled with
  stock characters acting stereotypical roles.
- Too heavy on the scripted dialog, which is well voiced, but lacking in
  interesting content.  Conversations have at most 1 or 2 branch points, but
  almost all have none except the option to end them early.
- Morrigan's cleavage and other low brow content to appeal to console owners.

Update: Ended up liking this less the more I played.  Perhaps this is because
once the initial impress wore off, it becomes obvious how little real game
there is here compared to Bioware classics like the BG-series.  This continued
until I now apparently lack even the desire to complete this, and since I'm
making it a point to stop playing games once I stop enjoying them, I'm closing
this task.

Despite some flaws, this is the best game in the Phantasy Star series and the
best RPG on the Genesis, though still mostly a pretty mindless farming
experience.

Complaints:
- NPCs randomly leaving your party is kind of annoying.
- 2-line text blocks turn extended dialog sequences into a button mash-fest.
- No descriptions of what spells do in game.  Had to find a guide online.
- Story is pretty standard for JRPGs.

Quit just short of the final battle, since beating the final boss would've
required me to level grind for several hours and I can pretty much guess what's

Officially retired from this project.  Some other people are still working on

accomplished its goals of creating a working server emulator anyway.

    - State "STARTED"    <span class="org-date">[2009-12-16 Wed 16:42]</span>
It'll definitely be constructive to wrap up the end of a year with an analysis
of it in relation to the tasks here.  That is, did these projects bring me
closer to my larger goals and what kinds of adjustments can I make to optimize
the next year?  

Along those lines, here's the observations for 2009:
- Listing out projects like this definitely improves productivity by many
  factors.  The main reason why it's worth the time to do so are: 1.) Keeping
  record of productive activities.  I can't even remember what I was doing from
  Jan-Mar (before creating this list), but if I want to know what I was doing
  in April 2009, I need only look here.  2.) Knowledge retention.  3.)
  Organization.  Prior to managing my life with org-mode, my activities were
  inherently disorganized.  This is now no longer a problem.
- In 2008, I wasted a ton of time working on an open source project.  In 2009,
  the biggest time-waster was day trading.  Day trading is a pretty mindless
  activity, and even in the best-case outcome, only increases monetary wealth
  at the sacrifice of the far more valuable intellectual wealth.  While true
  that they are not complete wastes, day trading and OSS projects (from which I
  gain no knowledge) are two things that a cost/benefit analysis reveals should
  be avoided for the near future (at least, as long as I have these far more
  important things to do).
- A year ago, I recall thinking I had the ultimate *nix development
  environment.  It turned out this was far from the case, and the large number
  of "Technology and Software" tasks I realized needed tackling proved that.
  Though it's possible to endlessly improve this, I definitely don't want to
  expend this percentage of time on it in future years, or I'll never get to
  the harder stuff.  I don't consider the time spent this year wasted in any
  sense though, as most of the work was related to development environments,
  and being *nix, it's cumulative.
- My life-long love affair with playing video games endlessly seems to be over,
  which is probably a good thing.  The amount of time spent playing them this
  year wasn't a significant negative factor in my time management, probably for
  the first time in my life.
- Spent too much time reading fiction and not enough time reading non-fiction.
  I don't consider this a bad thing as long as this ratio doesn't persist.  I
  did have a large quantity of these books queued up over the years, and
  reading a typical novel only takes a few days to a week, so it's accessibly
  tempting.
- Getting there from here is more work than anticipated.  Subsuming the massive
  amounts of knowledge on this agenda required more remedial work than I had
  expected -- all the more reason to reduce overhead and target effort
  optimally.
- Lists have one downside: the temptation to solve all the quick or easy tasks
  first.  While it may seem more rewarding to be closing multiple tasks a day,
  if they're all lower priority ones, it's better overall to trudge through the
  more important huge task which may very well take weeks to close.  Realizing
  this isn't the problem though; the main impediment is that it's often not
  possible to focus on highly complicated side-projects while multitasking
  job-related work, for example.
- Instantly abandon tasks the moment they seem pointless or significantly less
  important than originally conjectured.

Major goals for next year:
- Master Lisp programming to the point where it's the language I'm most
  effective in.  If I've read all the Lisp books on my list but still don't
  feel like a guru (a highly likely scenario), write games or other apps in it
  until I do.  Ignore temptations like Clojure until this is done.  The only
  caveat to this is that there are several things about Lisp that bother me
  (dynamic typing being the foremost).  As I spend more time in it, these
  problems may make it clear to me that the statically-typed/purely-functional
  road is the path for me (I'm already pretty sure this is the case, actually).
  If this feeling becomes unbearable, cut off Lisp work early.
- Master at least these math topics: Set theory, formal logic, lambda calculus.
- Be able to construct proofs far more naturally (something I always sucked
  at).
- Finish some remedial math refresher tasks in discrete math,
  differential/integral calculus, and linear algebra.  Having forgotten so much
  of this is a real hindrance sometimes.
- Finish SICP.
- Finish mastering every technical subject related to my current job (apart
  from app-specific domain knowledge) to the point where I can do any of it in
  my sleep.  I'm already pretty close to this, but there's a few topics I just
  haven't been able to force myself to completely take in.  This will
  unfortunately require spending some of my own time doing some MS development.
- If I still have time after this, finish the Algorithms book.
- Only once all this stuff is done, begin on the whole taxonomy of tasks
  including Haskell, category theory, type theory, and theorem proving.  But,
  I'm presuming I won't even get to this stuff until the following year anyway.
