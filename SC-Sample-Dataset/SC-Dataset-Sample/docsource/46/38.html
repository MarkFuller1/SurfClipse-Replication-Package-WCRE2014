        <span>This error stopping my work in my crucial time. The error is &quot;The underlying connection was closed: The connection was closed unexpectedly.&quot;.There are multiple WCF service I created in my project. But when I am requesting only one service this error is coming. I compare with other service, no difference. The service works fine in the morning, but afternoon it stops working and raising error.

I installed Silverlight 3.0 Tools for 2008 Sp1, Silverlight 3.0 Developer, WCF RIA Beta and Silverlight 4.0 runtime in my system in the morning. After getting this error I uninstalled WCF RIA Beta. But same issue.Could not find any solution. Please assist me how to solve this issue.</span>

        <span>I have my Windows 7 Ultimate PC here and I can connect to my worksite via the built-in VPN software in windows 7 no problem whatsoever.
 
I&#39;ve just built a second PC and installed Windows 7 Home Premium on it, it is sitting here right next to me on my same network and it refuses to connect via VPN.
 
Username and Password is OK, I&#39;ve perfectly mirrored the VPN configuration between the two machines and one connects and the other won&#39;t. 

I&#39;ve tried turning off all of the windows firewalls on the problematic system with no success.
 
Everytime it get&#39;s to verifying username and password and then it stalls there and eventually comes back with a 619 error. I&#39;ve checked the logging, but I can&#39;t see anything useful there (but maybe i don&#39;t know what to look for?).</span>

        <span>Got an application that listens to (a number of) UDP multicast data streams.

Application works correct on XP and Vista. 

On Windows 7 the application also works correct if the PC is directly connected to our (private multicast) network, only not if a VPN connection is used to the network. Th VPN connection itself works fine (i can ping the host machine) but no multicast is received.
 
Used Microsoft Network Monitor to trace the mulicast messages. If the PC is connected directly to the network, IGMP Report messages are send if the appliaction is started.

If the VPN connection is used, no IGMP Reports are send. IGMP queries are received from the router but the PC doesn&#39;t response with IGMP reports. Disabled the firewall but this didn&#39;t solve the problem. Any suggestions?</span>

        <span>I have a really annoying issue with my wireless network whereby on start-up or resume my lappy won&#39;t automatically connect to my wireless connection despite the fact that &quot;automatically connect&quot; is checked in properties and the wireless adapter is enabled. 
 
There are currently 4 available wireless networks, 1 which is mine and 3 which must belong to neighbours. If I right-click on any of those other 3 the only option available is connect and it seems they can&#39;t be configured, the problem with this being that if I left-click them the &quot;connect automatically&quot; box is always checked. If I uncheck the box, the next time I left-click that connection the &quot;connect automatically&quot; box is checked again. I am wondering if this is causing a conflict whereby Windows 7 doesn&#39;t actually connect automatically to any of them as they are all checked...? The only way to connect is if I manually click &quot;connect&quot;...?
 
So, is my problem that Windows 7 is getting confused and if so is there a way to stop those other networks defaulting to auto connect...? I have tried to find config options for the unwanted connections to delete them or remove auto connect but they either don&#39;t exist or are well hidden.
 
Or could it be that there is another solution to this problem...? 

Incidentally, my Windows 7 PC which has a wireless connection seems to connect automatically every time I boot it. Why does my lappy need a manual kick-start...?</span>

How would I go about running the code &quot;End&quot; when the user clicks on the &quot;X&quot; (close button) at the top right of my VB application. When they hit the X on my child window I need it to close the Exe. I can&#39;t do it just on unload because I have another button that unloads the window and I don&#39;t want the application to to close with that button. Thanks</span>

        <span>I have to say that this default Application is truly simple and easy to deal with, and that makes it all the more significant in my view. However, I am running into an odd problem, and I would like to see if anyone has had the same experience, and/or could offer their assistance in this matter.
 
I have linked all of my contacts to their FB profiles, and all seems to work extremely well. However, for reasons beyond my understanding, when I attempt to click on the &quot;Album&quot; icon (To view the photographs of a FB Friend), this App. always makes me go through a &quot;Force Close&quot;. This ONLY happens with ONE of my contacts though, as with every other contact I still retain the ability to view their FB Photo Albums. I was thinking that the one contact in question here, possibly has too many photographs for this App. to handle(?), but I can get it to work on a very rare occasion despite such. 
 
I would really like to hear from folks in regard to this issue, because it&#39;s puzzling, and somewhat irritating.
 
I have rebooted, and I have also taken the particular FB profile off of my contact list, and then re-applied it (All to no avail).
 
Here is the error message:</span>

        <span>Greetings!I have a process automation program running at my plant.  The application is written in VB (ver 5 or 6 I think).  There is a section of the app that records all alarms.  It stores these alarms in an Access db.  What bothers me is that is uses the same db all the time...and depending on the alarms rate it grows fast in size.  The program has a section where I can add sub-routines and call them from a scheduler inside the program.  I&#39;d like to add a routine that I could call from the scheduler once a month that will take the existing db, close it (if open still), and move it to a backup folder.  On the Alarm recorders next attempt to write to the db, it will see that the db does not exist and create a new one, with the same name, in the same location.Can any help?Thanks!Tim</span>

        <span>I am not a web host. I do have my own server that I host my company sites on and some of my friends use it as well.

I had someone ask me if I could host about ten pages on my server for him. He said the following,&quot; Hello.   What is your base hosting price... say for a dozen page static site?  (making some Page Rank sites on different hosts to mask the connections to my main website)&quot;

This question gave me an uneasy feeling, but then again I am not familiar with this tactic. I have two questions since the above was asked.

1. Is this illegal by search engine rules.
2. Can my websites be affected if it is.</span>

        <span>some vBulletin customers facing to that error message, with session table with attachment only. Other just work fine. It&#39;s not because of server load. The load is just around 0 - 0.1

I have increased wait_timeout to 200 and max_allowed_packet to 64MB. Each attachment file in those vBulletin is just around 1-3MB.

Is there any idea why and how to fix?</span>

        <br />
        <span>When using .net remoting, does the server limit incoming client remoting calls?

I find a particular remoting call (during ASP.NET page rendering) to take from 200ms to 1500ms. While the underlying data call is only 50ms.  Factoring in remoting overhead of 150ms per call, the only difference between the two cases is that the latter scenario has about a dozen more parallel remoting calls in progress.  So my guess is that when too many remoting calls are happening, some will get queued up?  I also doubt system resource is the cause of the delay because it is not nearly saturated.

Searching MSDN, I find the below:

http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms973907.aspx
clientConnectionLimit: specifies how
many connections can be simultaneously
opened to a given server. The default
is 2. This is exactly the same as the
connection limit on ServicePoint in
the net classes.

That seems awfully low to me and if were the case, my app&#39;s performance would have been much worse. Can someone confirm if there is indeed a connection limit or some other throttling in .net remoting?</span>

Now when the Close button (on the Access report) is pressed - of course the report goes away.  When I want to end the program - I bring up Form1 and press the Command1 button that allows me to QUIT the program Code:Private Sub Command1_Click()    Set appAccess = Nothing    Unload MeEnd SubMy problem is when the report goes away - I want my Form1 to maximize itself and bring the focus on to that object.  In order to do this, I need Visual basic to recognize the close button when it is fired - what is the code to do this?  And even if I get the code to do this - what is the procedure I need to put it under?  Is there a much better way for me to do the above besides recognizing the close button pressed?

2) I want to read only the first 5 lines.
3) Put the first five lines into a variable.
4) Close the file.
5) Display the contents of the variable.

I know how to use the fopen() but I have big problems just trying to read the first 5 lines only? I tried many things. I downloaded some search scripts which displayed the &lt;meta&gt; tag only from html pages...

What is this guy doing?

Well I have a big site and content is added and changed everyday. I have a dynamic  page that reads a directory for files and then puts a link (well it includes the file for reading on my php page). That works great! MY PROBLEM is that I want not only a link but a small description below it (basically the first five lines on the file)...

See so far:
 Quote:     if (isset ($content)) {
include (&quot;files/$content.html&quot;);
echo &quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;read.php&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Back to index&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&quot;;
} else {
    echo &quot;&lt;b&gt;Opening directory, reading files, and listing them as a link&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;;
    $handle = opendir(&#39;./files&#39;); 
    while (false !== ($file = readdir($handle))) { 
    if ($file != &quot;.&quot; &amp;&amp; $file != &quot;..&quot;) { 
echo eregi_replace (&quot;.html&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&lt;A HREF=&quot;read.php?content=$file&quot;&gt;$file&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;);
    } 
}
closedir($handle);

        <span>I recently loaded Baked Snack 1.7 on my phone as my first custom ROM - before that I had rooted stock Froyo. I tried two Baked Snack kernels and now have KingsxKlick bfs #9.
 
So I have all these variables and now I have a weird problem - my address book is force-closing on me every time I try to create a new contact. I haven&#39;t created a new contact in awhile, so I have no idea whether this could be related to my new ROM or kernel, or if it&#39;s a problem with the address book itself. I have had no other problems since installing the ROM and kernel.
 
I can input the new number for the contact, but when I try to name the contact it says it has encountered an error and needs to stop. This is the stock HTC People app, and I have tried it creating the contact as a regular phone contact and as a Google contact. No dice.
 
I&#39;ve also tried a battery pull, clearing cache, the basics.
 
Any thoughts, guys? I met a cute boy and I REALLY need to save his number.</span>

Should I take my received data and put it into a file and then read from the file? or is there something else I can do to make this work properly? [code]</span>

        <span>Pretty much the only thing I have changed is created a loop because I have one xmlstring and want to break it up and create tif files from it(which it actually does do).My problem is this: readbytes inside the while loop throws an exception at the last time through the loop that says I have an &quot;unexpected end of file; the following elements are not closed&quot; and lists them

[code]...

So there are tags left open after the readtofollowing(&quot;image&quot;).  I tried catching the exception to no avail, tried to read until eof, no avail.  I dont really need elements to be closed, I just need to continue because I created files using whats in the image tag.EDIT: I think my xmlstring is going to have times where it will be too big to do a parse without slowing down too much.../parsing binary data?</span>

        <span>I just finished writing something that i think will be useful to others.I googled a good bit of my afternoon trying to find how to dynamically create a self closing tag (like meta or link) in .net 1.1 and to my big surprise it wasn&#39;t such an obvious thing to do.So i wrote my own. I&#39;m sure .net experts have a better way to do this but for all the other intermediate .net programmers out there learning it as we go, I give you the HtmlGenericSelfClosing class.It inherits from the HtmlGenericClass so it behaves like it except that it wont let you add content or controls to it.Of course, that&#39;s something you can easily change with the source code right here. Like I said,i dont claim to be an expert so if you feel you can improve on my class,feel free to share it too.

        <span>I have an asp.net web page which works with a database. When I first upload it I never disposed the connections so after using the different modules of the application for sometime it would suddenly stop working saying the connection pool filled or something like that.To fix it when a user clicked a button I opened the connection, tell the database what I needed and finally disposed the connection.

This seemed to fix everything, in fact you can work with application all you want, the problem comes if you stop using it for certain time.So for instance, I have a module in my webpage where user can capture information for a certain product. When the user clicks in one button the info gets into the database. If the user is continuosly capturing data everything works fine, but if it goes for about 10 min when he clicks the button he will receive an error.&#160;To fix this the user has to log-in again.

Every module opens a connection to the database to verify the user identity, but then after it verifies it I dispose the connection so I don&#39;t think there is a problem.</span>

3rd - window - is an ancestor of 1st window and is&#39;s opened from 2nd window using window.showModalDialog.

And now what I need to achieve is to open 1, 2 and 3 window. Next after closing the 3rd one, refresh the 2nd one. And after closing the 2nd one, refresh the 1st one.

But there is one more assumption, I don&#39;t want to have any post-back during this process. </span>
