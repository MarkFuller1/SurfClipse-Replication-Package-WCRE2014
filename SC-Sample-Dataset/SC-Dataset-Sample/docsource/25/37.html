  to copy/paste them.
  Also, hexadecimal values (like <code>#3399FF</code>) are supported as well.
  </li>
  <li>
  The Family Tree layout algorithm produces better results for complicated family
  ties and is, in general, more stable with respect to the GEDCOM input data.
  </li>
  <li>
  Even for small zoom factors, the graph view always paints the true shape of Shape
  nodes and the true path of curved edges.
  Similarly, the overview now paints the true shapes and paths of these elements,
  too.
  </li>
  <li>
  Context views display the groups containing selected nodes, if the new setting
  'Hierarchy Aware' is enabled in the Preferences dialog.
  </li>
  <li>
  The display time of tooltips is customizable in the Preferences dialog.
  <a href="http://yed.yworks.com/support/qa/191" target="_blank" title="yEd Q&A forum entry #191">[Q&A&nbsp;191]</a>

  <li>Many bugfixes, great and small.</li>
</ul>

<h2>yEd 3.7 - Changes Since 3.6.1.1</h2>

<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  The new <b>Palette Manager</b> provides a comfortable means to manage palette
  sections.
  It allows to define which sections to display in yEd and the order in which the
  sections should be arranged.
  Additionally, the Palette Manager also allows to create new sections, change the
  content of existing sections, and import/export sections as GraphML files.
  Finally, it enables import of images and/or SVG symbols into user-created palette
  sections.
  </li>
  <li>
  <div style="float:right; margin-left:20px">
	<img src="../img/yed/palette_sections.png" class="frame" title="New palette sections" alt=""/>
	<br/>
	<div style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold">New palette sections</div>
  </div>
  The new <b>Properties Mapper</b> is a powerful tool to visualize custom properties of
  a graph's nodes and edges.
  It enables turning user-defined additional data that is stored with graph elements
  into visual properties of the corresponding elements, like, e.g., their line width,
  fill color, label text, width, line type, ...
  </li>
  <li>
  A new interface for conveniently using the <a href="http://www.iconfinder.com" target="_blank">IconFinder</a>
  icon search engine from within yEd allows importing symbols (live from the Internet)
  into user-created palette sections.
  </li>
  <li>
  Added a new palette section that supports <b>Entity Relationship</b> diagrams
  (ERD).
  In particular, this new section provides edges with domain-specific arrowheads
  and adornments for Crow's Foot notation.
  </li>
  <li>
  New palette sections with vector graphics (SVG) symbols for computers/network
  devices and for people.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  The Structure View tool window now supports searching in custom node properties.
  As a by-product, custom node properties can also be displayed and edited in the
  Structure View.
  </li>
  <li>Added support for PNG image export with transparent background.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bugfixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  Addressed an SVG import issue where umlauts were broken despite UTF-8 encoding
  of the file.
  </li>
  <li>
  Fixed "IllegalArgumentException: offsetLimit must be after current position" that
  could occur for CroppingLabel configurations.
  </li>
  <li>
  Fixed "/ by zero" error that occurred when double-clicking into an editor with
  a very low zoom level.
  </li>
  <li>
  Fixed "IllegalArgumentException: fromKey > toKey" that could occur when working
  with the Palette.
  </li>
  <li>...and some more.</li>
</ul>

<h2>yEd 3.6.1.1 - Changes Since 3.6.1</h2>

<h3>Bugfixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  Fixed a regression which affected, for example, the labels of a UML class node
  (stereotype, constraints, methods).
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>yEd 3.6.1 - Changes Since 3.6</h2>

<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  <div style="float:right; margin-left:10px; margin-top:5px">
	<img src="../img/yed/rot-elabel.png" class="frame" title="Auto-rotating edge label" alt=""/>
	<br/>
	<div style="text-align:center; margin-top:4px">Auto-rotating edge label</div>
  </div>
  New auto-rotation and auto-flipping support for edge labels.
  Edge labels can be configured to stay parallel to their corresponding edge segment,
  even in a dynamic scenario where the slope of the edge segment changes.
  <br/>
  Auto-flipping automatically flips the presentation of a label when it is upside-down,
  thus ensuring that users can understand the textual information in rotated labels.
  </li>
  <li>
  A new bus-style edge routing algorithm can be used to combine the edges in parts
  of a diagram where each node is connected to each other node.
  It produces edge paths that together form a concise, tree-like structure consisting
  of vertical and horizontal line segments.
  </li>
  <li>
  Local views, like, e.g., the Neighborhood view of a diagram, can be turned into
  documents of their own right.
  A new command in the context menu of local views enables this conversion.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  When moving a label, the box that indicates where it will be positioned after
  releasing the mouse button is now highlighted.
  </li>
  <li>Editor tabs now have each a small close icon: [X].</li>
  <li>Added new option in the label properties that enables underlining a label.</li>
  <li>Saving a diagram no longer deletes/resets the undo queue.</li>
  <li>
  Copying (parts of) a diagram to the clipboard now also copies the current background
  of the active editor.
  This behavior is now similar to exporting (parts of) a diagram.
  </li>
  <li>
  The markers of selected elements are no longer present in exported bitmap images
  or vector graphics.
  The previous behavior can be restored using a corresponding option in the respective
  export dialogs.
  </li>
  <li>
  Mouse double clicking when in Navigation Mode now toggles between zooming in on
  the view and restoring the previous zoom factor.
  </li>
  <li>
  Changed keyboard shortcut for switching to Full Screen presentation on Mac OS
  X to Command-Option-F.
  The previous shortcut conflicted with the Mac OS X keyboard command for minimizing
  the active window to the Dock.
  </li>
  <li>
  Changed keyboard shortcuts for switching to Edit Mode and Navigation Mode on Windows
  and Linux to Ctrl-Shift-E and Ctrl-Shift-W, respectively.
  This freed Ctrl-Shift-S to be used for the "Save As..." command.
  </li>
  <li>The rounded corners of BPMN symbols now use a fixed radius.</li>
  <li>Improved label selection behavior of Area Selection with Shift button pressed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bugfixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  Fixed NullPointerException that occured when typing into the search field of the
  Structure View without any open document.
  </li>
  <li>Addressed problems with SVG nodes sometimes not printing.</li>
  <li>
  Fixed "java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.String cannot be cast to B.A.B.A.A.F"
  exception which occurred for some BPMN graphs.
  </li>
  <li>Fixed "/ by zero" errors in Colorize Graph tool.</li>
  <li>Fixed "java.lang.IllegalStateException: path without any coordinates" exception.</li>
  <li>
  Fixed IllegalArgumentException which occurred when setting the straightness of
  a quadcurve edge to a value outside the legal range of 0.0 to 1.0.
  </li>
  <li>Corrected printing behavior when using 'Landscape' orientation.</li>
  <li>
  Corrected multi-selection issues when changing the colors of graph elements that
  had different colors.
  </li>
  <li>...and many more.</li>
</ul>

<h2>yEd 3.6 - Changes Since 3.5.0.2</h2>

<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  A specific layout algorithm for BPMN (Business Process Modeling Notation) was
  added that lets you arrange your BPMN diagrams faster than ever.
  <br/>
  This dedicated automatic layout algorithm supports BPMN diagrams with or without
  pools, and calculates a clear representation of your diagram both from scratch
  or using a given arrangement as sketch.
  </li>
  <li>Multiple labels per node are now supported by the user interface.</li>
  <li>
  <div style="float:right; margin-left:10px; margin-top:5px">
	<img src="../img/yed/multi-label-node-composition.png" class="frame" title="Multiple node labels" alt=""/>
	<br/>
	<div style="text-align:center; margin-top:4px">Use multiple (icon) labels<br/>to compose your node presentation</div>
  </div>
  Labels now support an icon which can be used stand-alone or in combination with
  the label text.
  </li>
  <li>Labels now also support bold and italics font styles.</li>
  <li>New convenient support to instantly convert nodes to labels and vice versa.</li>

  New comprehensive support for Swimlane diagrams has been added which comprises 
  visual representation, user interaction, and support for automatic layout.
  <br/>
  Swimlane diagrams can be easily modeled using the new swimlane nodes from the 
  palette which provide representations for rows and columns to which other nodes 
  (group nodes also) can be added. 
  Rows and columns can be interactively added, removed, resized, reordered, and 
  also nested.
  <br/>
  The nodes from a Swimlane diagram can be automatically arranged by a new dedicated 
  Swimlane layout algorithm.
  </li>
  <li>
  Four new tool windows, so-called context views, have been added that display specific 
  information related to selected nodes or edges, including neighborhood, predecessors, 
  successors, and the contents of folder nodes.

<h2>yEd 3.3 - Changes Since 3.2.0.1</h2>

<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  New support for so-called snap lines enables instant alignment of graph elements 
  and makes editing a diagram easier than ever.
  <br/>
  When moving or resizing graph elements, the mouse snaps to suitable coordinates 
  where other graph elements have their borders or centers and rests for an instant. 
  Indicative lines are displayed to provide the user with an additional visual feedback.
  <br/>
  Node alignment functionality covers alignment of node centers and sides of nodes. 
  Node resizing takes into account widths and heights of other nodes. 
  Support for equidistant placement and placement according to preferred distances 
  is provided for nodes and edges.
  </li>
  <li>
  New support for interactively creating and editing orthogonal edges.
  <br/>
  Edge creation yields an orthogonal edge path with alternating horizontal and vertical 
  edge segments. 
  Edge segments and bends can be easily moved while maintaining the orthogonal characteristic 
  of an edge path.
  </li>
  <li>
  New distribution tools. 
  Selected nodes can be distributed in horizontal or vertical direction so that 
  they there is an equal distance between the graph elements.
  </li>
  <li>
  Visual feedback around nodes that indicate valid targets during edge creation 
  and port relocation gestures.
  </li>
  <li>

  page. 
  It contains an Adobe&reg; Flash&reg; Player-based viewer for displaying the GraphML 
  file.
  <br/>
  Compared to the already existing export as a plain Flash file ("SWF Format"), 
  the viewer adds several configurable features like an overview and zoom buttons.
  </li>
  <li>
  Added new "Current Elements" section to the Palette tool window that shows representatives 
  of the current kinds of nodes and edges from the displayed graph. 
  The representatives are dynamically updated when the graph changes.
  <br/>
  The criteria used to decide whether graph elements are considered equal are conveniently 
  configurable.
  </li>
  <li>
  New "Editor" tab in the Preferences dialog that provides a variety of new configuration 
  options for graph editing.

  the creation of an edge of the corresponding type at the drop node.
  </li>
  <li>
  Dragging a node from the Palette tool window onto a group node adds the node to 
  the group.
  </li>

  property dialogs and property tables from working properly.
  </li>
  <li>Fixed a bug which occurred when edge grouping was used with multiple documents.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>

<h2>yEd 3.1.1 - Changes Since 3.1</h2>

<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  Added panning support to the editor windows when in Edit Mode. 
  Right-dragging the mouse (Command key-dragging on Mac OS X) moves the canvas.
  </li>
  <li>
  Label text optionally automatically adjusts to the width, the height, or both 
  width and height of their nodes. 
  </li>
  <li>
  Support for importing image files and SVG files via drag and drop gesture. 
  Image files and SVG files can be dragged to the section for user-defined graph 
  elements in the Palette tool window.
  <br/>
  Also, when dragged directly to the active editor window, a new image node is created 
  at the drop location.
  </li>
  <li>
  The Palette tool window supports clearing all user-defined graph elements at once.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Bugfixes</h3>
<ul>

  <li>
  Help pages that explain a layout algorithm and its options can be opened directly 
  from the algorithm's settings dialog.

  documents.
  </li>
  <li>
  If a layout algorithm cannot handle a given graph, it signals so by displaying

<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Improved startup time for the JNLP version with Java 1.6.</li>
