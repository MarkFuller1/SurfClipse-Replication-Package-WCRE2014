As everyone knows, unit testing is a great way of ensuring
that code actually does what it claims it does, and that over time, as
the system changes, it carries on doing the same thing.  Formal processes
like Extreme Programming (XP) depend heavily on consistent unit testing.
</p>
<p>
When used together, object-oriented design and comprehensive unit tests can lead to a very clean design, as the test-first methodology implies a user-based interface design, resulting in a public interface that is simple yet efficient.
</p>
<p>
However, when it comes to testing, sometimes these clean interfaces are not
as good as they could be.  There are often member variables that the test
suite would like to access but that have been scoped <code>private</code> or
<code>protected</code>, and making these members <code>public</code> would
expose the internals, ruining the clean design. C++ has a way of working
around this: by declaring the test suite as a <code>friend</code> class,
the access protection is sidelined.  In Java, a similar approach can be
used by making certain members <code>package</code> scope and putting the
test classes into the same package. However, this leads to an
unsatisfactory design, as some members are <code>private</code> or
<code>protected</code> for good reasons, and then an arbitrary set of
members are <code>package</code> scope solely for the current test suite.
</p>
<p>
However, there is a third option available to Java programmers.  The Java
Reflection API allows the program to introspect arbitrary classes at
runtime, accessing members at will.  Most competent Java
programmers should know this much, but what many don't know is that the security
layer preventing you from accessing <code>private</code> members is only
optional, and can be turned off.  This allows the system code to be
written without explicitly planning the unit tests, and if the unit tests
really do need to access a <code>private</code> or <code>protected</code>
member, they can.</p>

<p>Throughout this article, I shall deal with the simplest case:
fields. In Java Reflection, fields, methods, and constructors are all
treated in a very similar manner, so whenever I say "field" here, it can
generally be replaced with "method" and the examples will still work.
</p>

<h3>Does <code>private</code> Mean Private?</h3>
<p>
Let's begin by proving to ourselves that a <code>private</code> field is
really a private field, and this is not just something we've all been told.  First
we need a class with some <code>private</code> members; this is the test
class I shall use for the following examples.</p>

<pre><code>class FieldTest {
    public String publicString = "Foobar";
    private String privateString = "Hello, World!";
}</code></pre>

<p>
Here we have a simple class with two fields: one <code>private</code>
field and one <code>public</code> field.  We would assume that arbitrary
code can access the <code>public</code> field, but not the
<code>private</code> field.</p>

<pre><code>public class Test1 {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    System.out.println(new FieldTest().publicString);
    System.out.println(new FieldTest().privateString);
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>When we compile this we get: </p>

<pre><code>Test1.java:4: privateString has private access in FieldTest
    System.out.println(new FieldTest().privateString);
                       ^
1 error</code></pre>

<p>This shows that <code>private</code> fields really are private fields, as
the Java compiler won't allow access to them.
</p>

<h3>The Class Object</h3>
<p>
In Java 1.0, the <code>java.lang.Class</code> object was fairly
trivial. However, in Java 1.1, the Reflection API was added. A cursory
glance at the documentation reveals several interesting methods:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>getField()</code></li>
<li><code>getFields()</code></li>
<li><code>getDeclaredFields()</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
These methods return <code>Field</code> instances (arrays, in the latter
two) that allow us to see the name of the field and its type, and more
importantly, get its value.
</p>
<p>
It seems that if we can get a <code>Class</code> instance, we can call
<code>getField()</code> to get a <code>Field</code> instance, which we can
use to get at the value we want.  And the easiest way to get a
<code>Class</code> object for the class <code>Foo</code> is to write
<code>Foo.class</code>, a construct called a <i>class literal</i>.
</p>

<p>Calling <code>getField()</code> looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>import java.lang.reflect.Field;

public class Test2 {
  public static void main(String args[])
    throws Exception {
    Field f;
    
    f = FieldTest.class.getField("publicString");
    System.out.println("Public Field: " + f);

    f = FieldTest.class.getField("privateString");
    System.out.println("Private Field: " + f);
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>Running this gives us:</p>

<pre><code>Public Field: public java.lang.String FieldTest.publicString
Exception in thread "main"
  java.lang.NoSuchFieldException: privateString
	at java.lang.Class.getField0(Class.java:1735)
	at java.lang.Class.getField(Class.java:900)
	at Test2.main(Test2.java:10)</code></pre>

<p> So what happened here? The code managed to get a reference to
<code>publicString</code> but failed when trying to get a reference to
<code>privateString</code>. The exception thrown was
<code>NoSuchFieldException</code>, but I know it does exist, since I created
it.  However, the fine print in the API documentation for
<code>Class.getField()</code> clearly states, &quot;... the specified
<i>public</i> member field ...&quot;.  Time to try
<code>getFields()</code> and <code>getDeclaredFields()</code>.
</p>

<csinclude record="b/875" template="b/article_sidebar2.view">

<h3>Enumerating Fields</h3>
<p>
At first glance, <code>getFields()</code> and
<code>getDeclaredFields()</code> seem very similar. Nevertheless, a closer
read of the API documentation reveals that they are very different.
</p>
<p>
The method <code>getFields()</code> reflects (no pun intended) what the
Java programmer conceptually sees when programming: it enumerates all
publicly accessible fields in the class and all of its superclasses.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, <code>getDeclaredFields()</code> reveals how the class
is constructed. It enumerates fields, but only if they are actually
declared in that class; any inherited fields are ignored.
</p>
<p>
The reason for the existence of two methods (instead of a single method that returns
all fields, including inherited ones) seems to be so that simple dynamic
lookup of <code>public</code> fields can be achieved easily (using
<code>getField()</code> and <code>getFields()</code>) and generally does
the right thing. If a program wants to see the <code>private</code> fields,
it will probably want to handle inherited fields specially (for example,
an object-oriented debugger).
</p>
<p>
Exercising these methods is always a good thing, to check they do what we
expect. Here is a test for <code>getFields()</code>.</p>

<pre><code>import java.lang.reflect.Field;

public class Test3 {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    final Field fields[] =
        FieldTest.class.getFields();
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; fields.length; ++i) {
      System.out.println("Field: " + fields[i]);
    }
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>The output is rather predicable:</p>

<pre><code>Field: public java.lang.String FieldTest.publicString</code></pre>

<p>Now let's try the same test, but use <code>getDeclaredFields()</code> instead.</p>

<pre><code>import java.lang.reflect.Field;

public class Test4 {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    final Field fields[] =
        FieldTest.class.getDeclaredFields();
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; fields.length; ++i) {
      System.out.println("Field: " + fields[i]);
    }
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>We hope that this will yield all of the fields, both <code>public</code> and <code>private</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Field: public java.lang.String FieldTest.publicString
Field: private java.lang.String FieldTest.privateString</code></pre>

<p>Life is indeed good. Now that we can enumerate all of the fields in a
class, we can get the specific field we are after and hopefully manipulate
it however we want.</p>

<h3>Using Field Objects</h3>

<p>
Time to investigate what the <code>Field</code> object can do for us.
There are the classic <code>get()</code> and <code>set()</code> methods, a
large array of convenience methods to handle the getting/setting of a
particular primitive type (to avoid having to wrap the primitive in an
object manually), and a few methods to determine what the field is
(<code>getName()</code>, <code>getModifiers()</code>).
</p>
<p>
It is the <code>get()</code> method that we need, as we want to retrieve
the value of a <code>String</code> field. This method takes a reference to
the object that that we want to get the field from (this object is ignored
if the field is <code>static</code>).  So this next example should work
fine:</p>

<pre><code>import java.lang.reflect.Field;

public class Test5 {
  public static void main(String args[])
    throws Exception {
    final Field fields[] =
        FieldTest.class.getDeclaredFields();
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; fields.length; ++i) {
      if ("privateString".equals(fields[i].getName())) {
        System.out.println(
            fields[i].get(new FieldTest()));
        break;
      }
    }
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>However, running this produces an exception:</p>

<pre><code>Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalAccessException:
  Class Test5 can not access a member of class FieldTest
  with modifiers "private"
   at sun.reflect.Reflection.ensureMemberAccess(Reflection.java:57)
   at java.lang.reflect.Field.doSecurityCheck(Field.java:811)
   at java.lang.reflect.Field.getFieldAccessor(Field.java:758)
   at java.lang.reflect.Field.get(Field.java:228)
   at Test5.main(Test5.java:8)</code></pre>

<p>And everything was looking so good. However, there is hope.  Another
reading of the fine print in the API documentation leads to the
interesting line &quot;<i>If</i> this <code>Field</code> object enforces
Java language access control, and the underlying field is inaccessible,
the method throws an <code>IllegalAccessException</code>&quot; (emphasis
added). If enforcing access control is optional, there has to be a way to
turn it off.</p>

<h3>The Security Manager</h3>
<p>
The Security Manager in Java is designed to stop arbitrary code from
performing unwanted actions. It is primarily used in controlled
environments, such as Java applets, where you wouldn't trust the applet to
read files from your disk (since it could send your password database to a
cracker). However, in the common case of a Java application executed from
the command line, the security manager imposes few restrictions.
</p>
<p>
The exception we're getting comes from Java denying access to a
<code>private</code> field, as the field is &quot;not
accessible.&quot; This check doesn't involve the Security Manager, but
simply calls <code>isAccessible()</code> on the superclass of
<code>Field</code>, <code>AccessibleObject</code>. The accessibility of a
<code>private</code> field defaults to false, but a call to
<code>setAccessible()</code> will perform the appropriate security checks
on my credentials and hopefully give me access.</p>

<pre><code>import java.lang.reflect.Field;

public class Test6 {
  public static void main(String args[])
    throws Exception {
    final Field fields[] =
        FieldTest.class.getDeclaredFields();
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; fields.length; ++i) {
      if ("privateString".equals(fields[i].getName())) {
        fields[i].setAccessible(true);
        System.out.println(
            fields[i].get(new FieldTest()));
        break;
      }
    }
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>The only difference between this and <i>Test5.java</i> is the addition of the <code>setAccessible()</code> call. When we run this test we see: </p>

<pre><code>Hello, World!</code></pre>

<p>Which is exactly what we were after: we can access a <code>private</code>
field and see its value. Very similar code should allow us to edit this
field as well.</p>

<pre><code>import java.lang.reflect.Field;

public class Test7 {
  public static void main(String args[])
    throws Exception {
    final Field fields[] =
        FieldTest.class.getDeclaredFields();
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; fields.length; ++i) {
      if ("privateString".equals(fields[i].getName())) {
        FieldTest fieldTest = new FieldTest();
        Field f = fields[i];
        f.setAccessible(true);
        System.out.println(f.get(fieldTest));
        f.set(fieldTest, "Modified Field");
        System.out.println(f.get(fieldTest));
        break;
      }
    }
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>This code gives the predictable outcome:    </p>

<pre><code>Hello, World!
Modified Field</code></pre>

<p>Note that no amount of code will allow you to change the value of a
<code>final</code> field.</p>

<h3>The Security Manager, Part 2</h3>

<p>As I said earlier, the Java Security Manager only lets you access
<code>private</code> fields if you have appropriate rights.  Code that I
run on my desktop is trusted in some sense, as I have to explicity run
it. However, Java applets can be hidden on web pages and executed without
the user knowing, so these are untrusted.</p>

<p>This can be demonstrated by re-writing <i>Test6.java</i> as an
applet. This involves two parts, the actual Java code:</p>

<pre><code>import java.lang.reflect.Field;
import java.applet.Applet;
import java.awt.Label;

public class Test8 extends Applet {
  public Test8() {
    super();
    String s = "Field not found";
    try {
      final Field fields[] =
        FieldTest.class.getDeclaredFields();
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; fields.length; ++i) {
        if ("privateString".equals(fields[i].getName())) {
          fields[i].setAccessible(true);
          s = (String)fields[i].get(new FieldTest());
          break;
        }
      }
    } catch (Exception ex) {
      s = ex.getMessage();
    }
    add(new Label(s));
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>and an HTML page to load it: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;applet width="100" height="50"
        code="Test8.class"&gt;
    &lt;/applet&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

<p>It's not exactly a great example of applet programming, but it does the
job. Now, either load this HTML file into either a Java-enabled web
browser, or use the <code>appletviewer</code> that is supplied with the
JDK.  The result is shown in Figure 1.</p>

<img src="/onjava/2003/11/12/graphics/Test8.png" alt="Figure 1" width="421" height="149" /><br />
<i>Figure 1. Accessing private fields from an applet</i>

<p>As expected, attempting to access the
<code>private</code> field in a secure context has been blocked. The only
way around this is to &quot;sign&quot; the applet, so that the user can
see who wrote the code, and decide whether they trust them or
not. However, signing .jar files is beyond the scope of this
article, and best saved for another day.
</p>

<h3>Methods and Constructors</h3>

<p>
So far I have only shown examples of accessing fields via reflection.
However, to prove that this concept <i>does</i> work for methods and
constructors, here's an example of calling a <code>private</code> method.</p>

<pre><code>import java.lang.reflect.Method;

class MethodTest {
  private final String sayHello(final String name) {
    return "Hello, " + name;
  }
}

public class Test9 {
  public static void main(String args[])
    throws Exception {
    MethodTest test = new MethodTest();
    final Method[] methods =
        test.getClass().getDeclaredMethods();
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; methods.length; ++i) {
      if (methods[i].getName().equals("sayHello")) {
        final Object params[] = {"Ross"};
        methods[i].setAccessible(true);
        Object ret = methods[i].invoke(test, params);
        System.out.println(ret);
      }
    }
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, getting a list of the declared methods is straightforward, using
<code>getDeclaredMethods()</code>. Then the array is searched as before,
and the correct method made accessible.  The method that does the magic
is <code>invoke()</code>.  You call this on a <code>Method</code> object,
passing it the instance it should call the method on (unless it is a
static method, in which case you pass <code>null</code>), and an
<code>Object[]</code> of parameters to the method to be called.  If the
method is <code>void</code>, then either an empty array or
<code>null</code> is acceptable.  Java will also automatically marshal to
and from primitive types, so, for example, if you have a method <code>int
round (final float f)</code> that takes a <code>float</code> and
returns an <code>int</code>, the parameter array would have a single
instance of <code>java.lang.Float</code> and an instance of
<code>java.lang.Integer</code> would be returned.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Now that the Reflection API has been well exercised, let's bring it back
to the field of unit testing.  Say I wanted to write a unit test for
FieldTest. Checking that the public field is the correct string is
trivial:</p>

<pre><code>import java.lang.reflect.Field;
import junit.framework.TestCase;

public class Test10 extends TestCase {
  public Test10(final String name) {
    super(name) ;
  }
  
  public void test_reflection() throws Exception {
    FieldTest f = new FieldTest();
    assertEquals (f.publicString, "Foobar");
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>When this test case is executed, it works as expected. </p>

<pre><code>$ java Test10
.
Time: 0.036
 
OK (1 test)</code></pre>

<p>I could copy the loop I've been using to get a reference to the private
field into the test case, but that would be very ugly if there were 10
private fields I wanted to check.  Instead, a utility class is in
order. Here is <code>PrivateAccessor.java</code>:</p>

<pre><code>import java.lang.reflect.Field;
import junit.framework.Assert;

/**
 * Provides access to private members in classes.
 */
public class PrivateAccessor {
  public static Object getPrivateField (Object o,
  String fieldName) {
    /* Check we have valid arguments */
    Assert.assertNotNull(o);
    Assert.assertNotNull(fieldName);
    /* Go and find the private field... */
    final Field fields[] =
        o.getClass().getDeclaredFields();
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; fields.length; ++i) {
      if (fieldName.equals(fields[i].getName())) {
        try {
          fields[i].setAccessible(true);
          return fields[i].get(o);
        } catch (IllegalAccessException ex) {
          Assert.fail ("IllegalAccessException accessing " +
            fieldName);
        }
      }
    }
    Assert.fail ("Field '" + fieldName +
                 "' not found");
    return null;
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>The core of <code>PrivateAccessor.java</code> is the same as the previous
examples, but the code is more reliable, as it checks the inputs and uses
the <code>Assert</code> class to integrate with JUnit test cases. With
this class, when a test case needs access to a private field, it can use
<code>getPrivateField</code> to get a reference to the field, and the test
case does the right thing automatically if the field was not found or the
arguments were not valid.  The test case can then assume that is has been
given a valid object, removing some error checking code.  I now present
the final example, a JUnit test suite that tests <code>FieldTest</code>
and uses <code>PrivateAccessor</code>:</p>

<pre><code>import java.lang.reflect.Field;
import junit.framework.TestCase;
 
public class Test11 extends TestCase {
  public Test11(final String name) {
    super(name) ;
  }

  public void test_reflection() throws Exception {
    FieldTest f = new FieldTest();
    /* Assert we have a valid object */
    assertNotNull(f);

    /* Assert that the public field is "Foobar" */
    assertEquals (f.publicString, "Foobar");

    String s =
        (String) PrivateAccessor.getPrivateField(f,
                         "privateString");
    assertEquals (s, "Hello, World!");
  }
 
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    junit.textui.TestRunner.run (Test11.class);
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>And to prove that this works: </p>

<pre><code>$ java Test11
.
Time: 0.039
 
OK (1 test)</code></pre>

<p>By using <code>PrivateAccessor</code>, we can write our classes without having to 
compromise the visibility of fields and other members just for the sake 
of JUnit tests.  This way, we can do right by our sense of good
object-oriented design, and still expose our classes to automated testing code.</p>
