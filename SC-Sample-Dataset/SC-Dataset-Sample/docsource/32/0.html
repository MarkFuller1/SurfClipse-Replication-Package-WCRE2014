[03:48:01] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; I guess we do :)</span>
[03:49:05] <span class="d">&lt;bobmcw&gt; well, sorta</span>

[03:49:26] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; phew</span>
[03:49:35] <span class="d">&lt;bobmcw&gt; are you anti-testing?</span>
[03:49:41] <span class="d">&lt;bobmcw&gt; do you hate children?</span>
[03:49:42] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; I'm pro-testing</span>
[03:49:46] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; I'm anti-writing tests</span>
[03:49:53] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; especially when they look like this one</span>
[03:50:08] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; I mean didn't it occur to anyone to store the expected model as a string in a .txt file?? :)</span>
[03:50:25] <span class="d">&lt;bobmcw&gt; says the guy who uses ModelNode for 32 different purposes?</span>
[03:51:32] <span class="d">&lt;bobmcw&gt; none of this really helps testing my deploy() though, I don't think</span>
[03:53:52] <span class="d">&lt;bobmcw&gt; I feel like you tire of me quickly. :)</span>
[03:54:12] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; nah you're cool</span>
[03:54:36] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; just thinking about how one would really effectively unit test a deployer in isolation</span>
[03:54:49] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; it's not easy</span>
[03:54:50] <span class="d">&lt;bobmcw&gt; back in the days of old, we'd stand up just-enough JBossMC</span>
[03:54:59] <span class="d">&lt;bobmcw&gt; with the whole reloaded stuff from ALR</span>
[03:55:08] <span class="d">&lt;bobmcw&gt; just need an msc-reloaded or easy bootstrap</span>
[03:55:19] <span class="d">&lt;bobmcw&gt; from inside junit and rspec</span>
[03:55:22] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; it's a bit tricker than that because operations also have to be tested in domain mode</span>
[03:55:30] <span class="d">&lt;bobmcw&gt; screw ops, I just want my deployers</span>
[03:55:33] <span class="d">&lt;ALR&gt; bobmcw: It's called AS7.</span>
[03:55:41] <span class="d">&lt;ALR&gt; Which starts in about the same time as Reloaded did :)</span>
[03:55:44] <span class="d">&lt;bobmcw&gt; ALR: give me a @Before method</span>
[03:55:47] <span class="a">*** jamezp_afk is now known as jamezp</span>
[03:55:48] <span class="d">&lt;bobmcw&gt; for my unit tests</span>
[03:55:52] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; yeah I guess deployment chains could exist in a simple MSC</span>
[03:55:55] <span class="d">&lt;bobmcw&gt; AbstractAS7TestCase</span>
[03:56:13] <span class="d">&lt;bobmcw&gt; or AbstractDefaultAS7TestCaseFactoryLocatorImpl</span>
[03:56:15] <span class="d">&lt;bobmcw&gt; whatevs</span>
[03:56:46] <span class="d">&lt;bobmcw&gt; I know AS7 boots fast, but I'd like to fail-fast on my build, in units early in my modules</span>
[03:56:56] <span class="d">&lt;bobmcw&gt; instead of waiting until we test inside the AS with something ARQ-like</span>

[04:04:07] <span class="a">*** Binbin has quit IRC</span>
[04:04:53] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; yeah a 2-second test is no good when you have 1500 tests</span>
[04:05:29] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; reusing the same JVM would trim a lot off of it</span>

[04:09:07] <span class="d">&lt;bobmcw&gt; really it's more that our integs (which touch AS) are at the end of the build of about 12 modules</span>
[04:09:12] <span class="d">&lt;bobmcw&gt; I'd like to unit each of those as I go</span>
[04:09:18] <span class="d">&lt;bobmcw&gt; I could just arquillian-alike more often</span>
[04:09:48] <span class="d">&lt;bobmcw&gt; but under 1s would be stellar</span>

[06:32:27] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; if not, then replace mvn clean install with: sh build.sh</span>

[12:23:23] <span class="d">&lt;wolfc&gt; back to the use case of adding DS (or other stuff)</span>
[12:23:42] <span class="d">&lt;Jaikiran&gt; yep, there's a long thread on this in the AS7 dev forum</span>
[12:24:01] <span class="d">&lt;Jaikiran&gt; basically the old way of allowing user specific config file within the application won't be supported</span>
[12:24:21] <span class="d">&lt;Jaikiran&gt; so this is going to drive users to start adding the datasources to the standalone.xml</span>
[12:24:35] <span class="d">&lt;Jaikiran&gt; we do advertise multiple ways including CLI and other stuff to do this</span>
[12:24:41] <span class="d">&lt;Jaikiran&gt; but all that requires a server start</span>
[12:25:03] <span class="d">&lt;Jaikiran&gt; and obviously isn't straightforward compared to just copying a app specific file</span>
[12:25:05] <span class="d">&lt;wolfc&gt; yeah, here's my bit: <a href="http://fpaste.org/YOds/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://fpaste.org/YOds/</a></span>
[12:25:15] <span class="d">&lt;wolfc&gt; I use xsl</span>
[12:25:27] <span class="d">&lt;Jaikiran&gt; so i was actually expecting to see users start messing/fiddling with the standalone.xml in their own unique ways</span>

[12:27:09] <span class="d">&lt;Jaikiran&gt; for example, a app-specific-standalone-overlay.xml (or whatever oyu call it) with app specific configs which would then be &quot;copied over&quot; to the standalone.xml by the server</span>

[12:27:20] <span class="d">&lt;Jaikiran&gt; but haven't given it more thought</span>
[12:27:23] <span class="d">&lt;pilhuhn&gt; darranl the model description for security seems odd. When I do a :read-resource on security-domain=other I get tons of stuff. But this does not show for read-children-types or anything</span>

[12:29:29] <span class="d">&lt;wolfc&gt; or maybe a place where we run-once admin operations from</span>
[12:29:43] <span class="d">&lt;wolfc&gt; could be something as simple as a text file</span>
[12:30:53] <span class="d">&lt;Jaikiran&gt; ideally the goal of all this should be that deploying these resources should require the server to be up and running</span>
[12:31:20] <span class="d">&lt;Jaikiran&gt; the user could just package it along with his app and whenever his app gets picked up during deployment, that's when all this processing should automagically happen</span>
[12:31:31] <span class="d">&lt;Jaikiran&gt; yeah, a text file would do too</span>
[12:31:56] <span class="d">&lt;Jaikiran&gt; we just need something on the server to identify that text file and trigger the appropriate operations at the right time</span>

[15:24:42] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; why it gets to a certain point I mean</span>
[15:25:02] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; might be because two JVMs start up at the same time and there's an inherent race condition in hotspot or something</span>

[15:27:09] <span class="d">&lt;davidbos&gt; dmlloyd: if there is a race condition it's funny that it *always* happens for in that jboss.network.public service</span>
[15:27:43] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; davidbos: it might be interesting to insert a random sleep (say 1-10 seconds) in the main method so they start up staggered, see if the problem still occurrs</span>

[16:51:00] <span class="d">&lt;tdiesler&gt; dmlloyd, this must be a race of some sort. It works in most cases and is also affected by logging</span>
[16:51:45] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; a race condition can't exist in a single-threaded environment</span>
[16:51:59] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; the problem doesn't occur with trace logging enabled?</span>

[16:52:55] <span class="d">&lt;tdiesler&gt; dmlloyd, it might be an MSC issue. i.e. the service that holds the ModuleSpec is not found somehow</span>

[17:02:09] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; emuckenhuber: okay so on new controllers, since both ops and model descriptions are address-based it seems like the existing registry could continue to work, with an added provision for deployment-scoped stuff?</span>
[17:04:31] <span class="d">&lt;emuckenhuber&gt; dmlloyd: well i don't really see a problem with the model descriptions and ops - rather that there is no really consistent way to navigate through the tree</span>
[17:04:38] <span class="d">&lt;emuckenhuber&gt; once there are proxies etc.</span>
[17:05:36] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; emuckenhuber: can you give an example?</span>

[17:10:03] <span class="d">&lt;hbraun&gt; yes</span>
[17:10:24] <span class="d">&lt;maeste2&gt; hbraun: porbably the reason is because you are passing the properties as undefined</span>

[17:13:29] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; emuckenhuber: I see, you're having a global op handler rather than registering a read op handler on each registered subnode</span>
[17:14:03] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; darranl: what are the actual requirements for the security interceptors?  simply to associate a Subject?</span>
[17:15:29] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; dmlloyd: auto-registering a handler for each subresource would only work if we removed the check that barf if another handler gets registered for the same op name</span>
[17:15:31] <span class="d">&lt;darranl&gt; dmlloyd, that is the part I need to dig into now, I think that is potentially the first part but to also perform the authorization check and I am also not sure if it needs to handle the RunAs behaviour as well</span>
[17:15:35] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; emuckenhuber: back in the dark ages when this was written, I assumed that each registered node would get global ops added to it separately.</span>
[17:15:53] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; bstansberry: that check should be only per-node right?</span>
[17:16:23] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; yeah, but what if the thing doing the registration wants to override the global handler?</span>
[17:16:26] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; darranl: our interceptors are split into 2 or 3 roles.  The client interceptor, the view interceptor, and the component interceptor.</span>
[17:16:53] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; bstansberry: yeah that would have to be allowed somehow for sure</span>
[17:17:18] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; bstansberry: I'm not proposing that necessarily as a solution, just reconciling what I remember with what we're doing today</span>
[17:17:44] <span class="d">&lt;emuckenhuber&gt; dmlloyd, bstansberry: well having separate op-handlers would most likely make recursive reads more complex?</span>
[17:18:08] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; maybe not</span>
[17:18:12] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; back then I imagined that the one doing the registering would actually add the global handlers, though that's probably a bit inconvenient :)</span>
[17:18:21] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; haha, yeah</span>
[17:18:45] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; my goal == subsystem authors don't have to do complex stuff</span>
[17:18:54] <span class="c">* bstansberry has failed miserably at his goal</span>
[17:19:18] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; nah remember: it could be worse!</span>
[17:19:21] <span class="c">* bstansberry fears new-controllers is actually going to be even harder on subsystem authors :(</span>
[17:19:48] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; if there are usability issues with the API, now's the time to raise the flag</span>
[17:20:02] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; I will, or won't, today</span>
[17:21:11] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; my comment above was based on previously we did a lot of runtime ollback work auto-magically; now it's the task of the handlers</span>
[17:21:40] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; which is better, just more for the handler author to do right</span>
[17:21:48] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; yeah, that is true</span>
[17:22:09] <span class="d">&lt;bobmcw&gt; if my stuff gonna hafta change?  can you give me a heads-up, or fork torquebox.git and do it for me? :)</span>
[17:22:22] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; I predict the latter</span>
[17:22:26] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; we will have to make sure we establish a good best-practice - i.e. things which add services should be factored out and shared since removal ops may have to re-add on rollback</span>
[17:22:43] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; baileyje: ^^^</span>
[17:22:58] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; that's the one that I don't like</span>
[17:23:09] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; ?</span>
[17:23:28] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; not only do we have to force op handlers to generate compensating ops, but we also have to implement each reverseable op twice, in essence</span>
[17:23:44] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; it would be nice if we could somehow leverage the compensating op, but I don't see how we could do it</span>
[17:23:54] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; yeah</span>
[17:24:58] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; we could ditch the compensating ops, unless hbraun pil-afk-bbl or aloubyansky have developed an unreported love for them</span>
[17:25:00] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; but...</span>
[17:25:14] <span class="c">* bstansberry fears we are off on tangents and are ignoring emuckenhuber</span>
[17:25:39] <span class="a">*** stliu has quit IRC</span>
[17:25:43] <span class="d">&lt;hbraun&gt; bstansberry: i don't yet make use of them</span>
[17:25:46] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; I'd vote for ditching compensating ops... and also for not ignoring emuckenhuber :)</span>
[17:26:08] <span class="d">&lt;darranl&gt; I'd vote for that - I can drop one of my TODOs ;-)</span>
[17:27:11] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; emuckenhuber: back to your original point, which as I see it is a tighter relationship between the registry and the model</span>
[17:27:43] <span class="d">&lt;hbraun&gt; does that mean any op execute on the domain will obey to the all or nothing approach?</span>
[17:27:54] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; darranl: anyway normally the client interceptor *factory* should be serializable (at least that's my current notion) but the other two need not be.</span>
[17:28:15] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; hbraun: the rules for a domain op are specified by the rollout plan</span>
[17:28:38] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; darranl: the weird thing is though, with remote invocation, the calling principal comes from the connection, at least potentially.  If you connect as &quot;darranl&quot;, then that's your principal and there's no reason to use JAAS on the client</span>
[17:28:41] <span class="d">&lt;hbraun&gt; bstansberry: so, compensating op's don't play a role here?</span>
[17:29:04] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; hbraun: it's a question of implementaiton</span>
[17:29:06] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; right. we were using them as a means of rolling back stuff</span>
[17:29:18] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; but we are moving away from that</span>
[17:29:18] <span class="d">&lt;darranl&gt; dmlloyd, yes in the past JAAS on the client was just to associate on a ThreadLocal but didn't perform actual auth</span>
[17:29:24] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; hbraun: the new op handlers are required to be able to roll back any modification.</span>
[17:29:56] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; the issue hbraun is seeing is ops pass on all the hc's but fail on *every* server</span>
[17:30:06] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; that's a policy question</span>
[17:30:40] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; by default at least, if that happens, the op should be reverted on the HCs (i.e. not update the domain/host models)</span>
[17:30:43] <span class="d">&lt;hbraun&gt; well, all i am saying is I cannot foresee all the implications it has, when dropping the compensating ops</span>
[17:30:51] <span class="d">&lt;hbraun&gt; i didn't touch the complex use cases yet</span>
[17:30:51] <span class="b">*** fnasser has joined #jboss-as7</span>
[17:31:01] <span class="d">&lt;hbraun&gt; like operation or deployment plans</span>
[17:31:12] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; there are no other users of them hbraun.  the new controllers are transactional</span>
[17:31:15] <span class="d">&lt;hbraun&gt; but if you say it will not be  related, then fine</span>
[17:31:35] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; the question about retaining compensating ops becomes about user interface</span>
[17:31:50] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; basically it enables a sort of &quot;undo&quot;</span>
[17:32:02] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; what can still happen is some op succeeds on all the hc's and on some servers, and the rollout-plan specifies that that is acceptable</span>
[17:32:06] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; but then it's a fairly expensive feature</span>
[17:32:07] <span class="d">&lt;hbraun&gt; so compensating ops are merely a way to rollback from the client side and only for single operations?</span>
[17:32:26] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; well even a multi-step operation can have a compensating op</span>
[17:33:32] <span class="d">&lt;hbraun&gt; well, the console will not support undo (is in ctrl-z)</span>
[17:34:03] <span class="d">&lt;emuckenhuber&gt; bstansberry: not sure if tighter relationship is the right description :)</span>
[17:35:09] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; well, it's an actual contract, whereas right now there is none</span>
[17:35:31] <span class="d">&lt;emuckenhuber&gt; what i originally wanted is to have an authoritative view on how to navigate thorugh the tree as well as a clear separation between attributes and chidlren</span>
[17:35:52] <span class="d">&lt;emuckenhuber&gt; so that this navigatioNode.getModel() gives you the attributes only</span>
[17:36:29] <span class="a">*** hardy_ has quit IRC</span>
[17:36:30] <span class="d">&lt;emuckenhuber&gt; and children are separate - so that a e.g. non-recursive read operation does not need to prune the children</span>
[17:37:16] <span class="d">&lt;emuckenhuber&gt; although that shouldn't be really visible to any client - mainly for the controller...</span>
[17:37:36] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; how about for op handlers?</span>
[17:38:22] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; that's the drawback I see -- if op handlers expect to be able to navigate to child resources via modelNode.get(&quot;connector&quot;, &quot;http&quot;) etc</span>

[17:41:18] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; I told kkhan a while ago that I have a totally broken subbranch where I started trying to get global ops working, which led into proxy controllers</span>

[17:44:11] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; emuckenhuber: perhaps you can take a look at this subbranch when I push it and see what it would take to do the global ops using a NavigationNode approach</span>
[17:44:55] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; kkhan: give me a few minutes</span>
[17:45:19] <span class="d">&lt;emuckenhuber&gt; bstansberry: ok, sure</span>
[17:45:52] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; dmlloyd: the fundamental question IMO is whether adding an explicit server-side-only contract between the registry stuff and the model node structure makes sense</span>
[17:47:02] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; well maybe having the model be a single monolithic chunk is a bad idea</span>
[17:47:25] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; I mean it'd be just as easy to have a separate node for each resource</span>
[17:47:35] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; and it'd sure make write transactions more efficient</span>
[17:47:42] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; true</span>
[17:48:05] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; the registry already ties them all together another way</span>
[17:49:02] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; best of all it's a change that won't affect the op handlers :)</span>
[17:49:07] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; well most of them!</span>
[17:49:45] <span class="d">&lt;emuckenhuber&gt; yeah, it was pretty easy to do that with the old server controller - never tried with the domain stuff though :)</span>
[17:49:55] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; well, except every &quot;add&quot; handler is creating empty child nodes for each child type</span>
[17:50:10] <span class="d">&lt;emuckenhuber&gt; true, but we could tie that together with the registry</span>
[17:50:12] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; although getting rid of that is actually a benefit</span>
[17:50:22] <span class="a">*** JimMaq has quit IRC</span>
[17:50:33] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; yeah it cleans up the global ops a lot because there's no ambiguity between an attribute and a resource</span>
[17:51:15] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; tangent: we need to make &quot;resource&quot; a real concept</span>
[17:51:26] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; the old way we did global ops might work out well here: you specify a global op which applies to all nodes, but a node can override a global op</span>
[17:51:32] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; yeah agreed there</span>
[17:51:48] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; e.g. emuckenhuber 's NavigationNode looks an awful lot like a Resource to me</span>
[17:51:49] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; it'd have to move to the registry</span>
[17:51:53] <span class="d">&lt;emuckenhuber&gt; yes</span>
[17:52:10] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; I don't have that one</span>
[17:52:47] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; it's the source he linked in his email proposing this conversation</span>

[17:53:35] <span class="d">&lt;emuckenhuber&gt; well it's a lot like ModelNode - since it was quick to change the code ;)</span>

[17:54:37] <span class="a">*** slaboure has quit IRC</span>
[17:54:45] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; I dunno I'd argue for it all to be on registry</span>
[17:55:01] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; ops to get/modify the resource at that address</span>
[17:55:02] <span class="a">*** aslak has quit IRC</span>
[17:55:03] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; add/remove operations</span>
[17:55:16] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; drop the whole subtree</span>
[17:55:26] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; and, the write transaction stuff could easily be there as well</span>
[17:56:02] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; if the whole tree shared a write lock (which it has to anyway), each node on the registry could keep a read and a modify copy, and the modify copy is only visible from the lockign thread</span>
[17:56:38] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; if we add to that, restoring the ability for per-node op handlers to override global ones, seems like we solve all the problems at once</span>
[17:57:00] <span class="a">*** kevinpollet has quit IRC</span>
[17:57:01] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; an op is still located by navigating the registry first, even if it's a global default op</span>
[17:57:10] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; proxy op handlers work again for dealing with global ops</span>
[17:57:50] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; and we can still have the logic where step handlers can only access their sub-tree of resources as well as operation registration</span>
[17:58:09] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; we need a strong alignment between operation address and resource address else it'll be chaos</span>
[17:58:31] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; for sure</span>

[17:59:54] <span class="d">&lt;emuckenhuber&gt; the only thing i don't like having it all on the registry are that you register handlers using wildcards</span>
[18:00:27] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; yeah that's for the case where I have one op that applies to, say, any deployment</span>
[18:00:45] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; resources only exist at &quot;real&quot; addresses though</span>
[18:01:04] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; and when an op is resolved, it first checks for exact match, then wildcard(s), then global default, then fail</span>
[18:01:52] <span class="d">&lt;emuckenhuber&gt; ok, that sounds reasonable</span>
[18:01:58] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; so I picture the conceptual address looking like this: &quot;foo=bar,baz=*,**&quot; meaning exactly bar of foo, then any of baz, then any recursively under that as a default</span>
[18:02:32] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; for cases like &quot;foo=*,baz=zap&quot; vs &quot;foo=bar,baz=*&quot; I think the original code preferred the latter (exact match first)</span>

[18:04:33] <span class="a">*** ChanServ sets mode: +v dimitris_</span>
[18:05:29] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; emuckenhuber: your problem with the wildcards related to requests for, e.g. /socket-binding-group=x/socket-binding=*:read-attribute(name=port)</span>
[18:05:53] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; the ambiguity in the meaning of *</span>
[18:06:25] <span class="d">&lt;emuckenhuber&gt; hmm, yeah that's what i'm thinking about atm</span>
[18:06:59] <span class="d">&lt;kkhan&gt; Is NewModelControllerImpl where I should start looking?</span>
[18:07:40] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; there and NewOperationContextImpl; that's the essence of it</span>
[18:08:57] <span class="d">&lt;emuckenhuber&gt; bstansberry: hmm crap, i need to leave for a couple of minutes.. i'll ping you again when i'm back</span>
[18:09:05] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; np</span>
[18:09:20] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; perhaps there is not a need to support reading from a wildcard</span>
[18:09:24] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; or is there?</span>
[18:09:48] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; I think it's reasonable for only wildcard operations to match at wildcard addresses</span>
[18:10:07] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; but this also means that a wildcard may only be used in the last segment, which may be undesirable</span>
[18:10:18] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; there's basically two possible approaches:</span>
[18:10:26] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; yeah, that's undesirable</span>
[18:11:04] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; well before I go into that, if read-attribute is a global default op, then my last stement is a lie</span>
[18:11:11] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; you could have wildcards wherever you want</span>
[18:11:23] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; because only the global op will match it anyway</span>
[18:11:29] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; but it *will* be matched</span>
[18:11:41] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; then the global op just handles * with a simple iteration/recursive match</span>
[18:11:55] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; so I guess it's not so much of a problem after all</span>
[18:12:12] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; yes, that might deal with it</span>
[18:12:53] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; to handle full recursion it probably makes sense to support ** as an address key</span>
[18:13:11] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; /socket-binding-group=*/**=*</span>
[18:13:34] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; for the purposes of op location ** is the same as *</span>
[18:13:42] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; the op can then do with it what it wants</span>
[18:14:11] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; could make dealing with recursive structures easier</span>
[18:14:12] <span class="a">*** torben|afk has quit IRC</span>
[18:15:10] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; particulary log filters</span>
[18:15:42] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; you could do something like, read /subsystem=logging/filter=*/**=*/level=INFO or something</span>
[18:16:04] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; dunno, it's a general concept but having support for that could solve a number of problems too</span>
[18:16:15] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; recursive read becomes read:/**=*</span>
[18:16:22] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; or however it's formatted</span>
[18:16:27] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; /**=*:read I guess</span>

[18:23:51] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; though stepsRemaining can and will grow so it might be a bit demoralizing to see your progress meter shrink :)</span>

[18:25:09] <span class="d">&lt;Nihility&gt; Jaikiran: hey i think we probably do need to implement resource enlistment on @DataSourceDefinition</span>
[18:25:54] <span class="d">&lt;Nihility&gt; Jaikiran: I dont see a resource out there that does it on its own</span>
[18:26:15] <span class="d">&lt;Jaikiran&gt; Nihility: yeah, i think that's how we did it in AS6</span>
[18:26:18] <span class="d">&lt;Jaikiran&gt; from what i remember</span>
[18:26:23] <span class="d">&lt;darranl&gt; dmlloyd, various vendors have had progress meters going in the wrong direction for ages ;-)</span>
[18:27:06] <span class="d">&lt;Nihility&gt; Jaikiran: the annoying thing is that that means we have to wrap it in a proxy</span>
[18:28:03] <span class="d">&lt;Jaikiran&gt; right</span>
[18:28:13] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; bstansberry: I'm thinking it might be a good idea to allow ops to detect whether the current running operation is going to be rolled back regardless of what happens in their step.  (as an enhancement of course, after we merge this beast)</span>
[18:28:20] <span class="d">&lt;Jaikiran&gt; we do have tests around that in ejb30/lite/packaging</span>
[18:28:29] <span class="d">&lt;Jaikiran&gt; those aren't functional due to other reasons now</span>
[18:28:44] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; dmlloyd. like a context.isRollbackOnly() ?</span>
[18:28:45] <span class="d">&lt;Nihility&gt; Jaikiran: you are saying the TCK does test enlistment of @DataSourceDefinition?</span>
[18:28:52] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; bstansberry: that way they won't remove services that will have to be re-added again</span>
[18:28:53] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; bstansberry: yeah.</span>
[18:29:15] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; bstansberry: the tricky part is, right now we do our verification *after* everything is done</span>
[18:29:33] <span class="d">&lt;Jaikiran&gt; Nihility: from what i remember it tests the DS operations within a ejb method and *i think* expects the tx enrollment semantics</span>
[18:29:39] <span class="d">&lt;Jaikiran&gt; let me give a quick check</span>
[18:29:43] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; bstansberry: and it's the plan, not the ops, that decide whether we're rolling back...</span>
[18:30:02] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; bstansberry: so the context would have to be able to know when the conditions for rollback have been met</span>
[18:30:20] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; bstansberry: maybe it's too complex :) the benefit would be largely limited to non-distributed operations</span>
[18:30:20] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; yep</span>
[18:30:34] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; i kind had that notion in the concurrent rollout stuff</span>
[18:30:38] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; kind of</span>
[18:31:11] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; though it'd help in a different way on distributed operations</span>
[18:31:13] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; there was a central registry where as each thread that was pushing changes out to servers got done with a server, it reported</span>
[18:31:32] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; since if rollback criteria were reached, the domain-level op would stop trying to apply it everywhere</span>
[18:31:34] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; and threads wouldn't push to a server w/o checking first w/ the registry</span>
[18:31:57] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; yeah, soudns like we're converging on the same concept</span>
[18:32:08] <span class="d">&lt;Nihility&gt; Jaikiran: ok well that should be a simple fix</span>
[18:32:12] <span class="d">&lt;Nihility&gt; ill leave a note for that</span>

[18:32:19] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; basically the context has to be trainable to know when rollback criteria are met</span>
[18:32:24] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; if we do that, the rest is pretty easy</span>
[18:32:29] <span class="d">&lt;Jaikiran&gt; Nihility: just checked. it justs checks for a getConnection() and nothing more</span>
[18:32:33] <span class="d">&lt;Jaikiran&gt; so pretty basic</span>
[18:32:42] <span class="d">&lt;Nihility&gt; ah</span>
[18:32:43] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; so we have to evaluate what the range of rollback criteria are</span>
[18:33:28] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; that's there.</span>
[18:34:00] <span class="d">&lt;bobmcw&gt; man, if only we had people who understood transactions in this company... we should hire some, from HP or something</span>

[18:36:53] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; bstansberry: okay so really it sounds like we need a layer to interpret the execution plan and apply it to the context</span>
[18:36:56] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; emuckenhuber kkhan : <a href="https://github.com/bstansberry/jboss-as/tree/new-controllers-proxies" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/bstansberry/jboss-as/tree/new-controllers-proxies</a></span>
[18:37:06] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; because the model controller doesn't know anything about servers</span>
[18:37:14] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; all it knows is, this op failed, this op succeeded</span>
[18:37:45] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; if we could get it into the controller that'd be best though, so if the op can somehow hook into the evaluation process we could reuse these exact classes</span>
[18:38:01] <span class="a">*** sannegrinovero has quit IRC</span>
[18:38:06] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; if we had a way of translating op success/failure to server success/failure I mean</span>
[18:38:14] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; dmlloyd: one sec</span>
[18:38:42] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; emuckenhuber, kkhan :  that branch started as an effort to get the global handlers working</span>
[18:39:16] <span class="d">&lt;kkhan&gt; Is any of that working in the main branch?</span>
[18:39:42] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; quickly sequed into looking at how proxied calls would work, since many recursive ops end up calling proxies</span>
[18:40:30] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; the main part for proxies is ProxyStepHandler, which would get added as a step, and then invoked and then would be responsible for calling the proxy and integrating its result</span>
[18:40:36] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; kkhan: any of what?</span>
[18:40:59] <span class="b">*** sannegrinovero has joined #jboss-as7</span>
[18:40:59] <span class="a">*** ChanServ sets mode: +v sannegrinovero</span>
[18:41:07] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; ideally ProxyStepHandler would be transactional, and would use the result of completeStep() to apply a commit/rollback answer to the proxied operation</span>
[18:41:12] <span class="d">&lt;kkhan&gt; You said &quot; that branch started as an effort to get the global handlers working&quot;, so I'm not clear about what if anything works where :-)</span>
[18:41:49] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; are you trying to get an angle on the remoting integration kkhan?</span>
[18:42:12] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; kkhan: nothing in new-controllers works anywhere</span>
[18:42:13] <span class="d">&lt;kkhan&gt; First I'm trying to understand the new controllers, is there anything runnable?</span>
[18:42:17] <span class="a">*** asoldano has quit IRC</span>
[18:43:00] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; dmlloyd: oy, yeah</span>
[18:43:03] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; if you want an easy start, just implement a remoting protocol which accommodates the NewModelController execute method for proxies</span>
[18:43:15] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; and one which implements NewModelControllerClient</span>
[18:43:19] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; bstansberry: ...back onto the deployment plan topic... or, perhaps we can simply enable setRollbackOnly on the op context and allow ops to control it after all, and just utilize that in domain ops to implement execution plans - that would relieve a lot of API pressure</span>
[18:43:24] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; I write this partiallym then got sicke</span>
[18:43:27] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; sick</span>
[18:43:29] <span class="d">&lt;kkhan&gt; ok, thanks</span>
[18:43:38] <span class="a">*** sannegrinovero has quit IRC</span>
[18:43:48] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; so I realize now it's even less complete than I thought :(</span>
[18:44:12] <span class="d">&lt;kkhan&gt; I'm sick too :-( Cold + eye infection :-S</span>
[18:44:39] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; the proxy handler for remoting would use the API kkhan is going to work up</span>
[18:44:46] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; it should all fit together</span>
[18:45:23] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; note that the API for communicating remotely (and transactionally) with a domain participant (&quot;slave&quot;) should not be part of the public client library though</span>
[18:45:29] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; the thing to look at in that branch is the ProxyOperationControl</span>
[18:45:40] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; it's not</span>
[18:45:52] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; okay I just want to make sure that's out there</span>
[18:45:53] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; :)</span>
[18:45:59] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; sure, good</span>
[18:46:00] <span class="d">&lt;kkhan&gt; ok, I think I'll start porting my remoting bits and pieces over and take it from there</span>
[18:46:24] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; okay feel free to ask questions rather than be stuck - it may not be possible for this to be up &amp; running for a few days</span>
[18:47:56] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; when this conversation ends i'll spend a couple more minutes on ProxyStepHandler just so it's a bit more apparent what the problems it was trying to solve are</span>
[18:48:20] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; bstansberry: so then for deployment plans, if we have a context set/isRollbackOnly, we could use a step handler which is auto-prepended to domain controller operations which parses the plan and does all the dirty work of figuring out host/server distribution, adding proxy ops as necessary which know how and when to give up processing due to failure</span>
[18:48:24] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; basically they relate to getting a result from the proxy and properly integrating it with the parent operation that's led to the call to the proxy</span>
[18:48:44] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; yeah, cool, sounds exactly what is needed</span>
[18:49:38] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; dmlloyd:  yes, that's exactly how I saw it.</span>
[18:49:45] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; cool</span>
[18:50:04] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; then.... I'll add the rollback thing to the context</span>
[18:50:18] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; the part that's needed is the input from the HC's telling what the server operations are</span>
[18:50:34] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; yeah, more proxy steps</span>
[18:50:44] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; so DC adds HC query steps, then those steps add server steps</span>
[18:51:00] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; if any step exceeds the criteria they setRollbackOnly</span>

[18:51:13] <span class="a">*** ChanServ sets mode: +v sannegrinovero</span>
[18:51:20] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; then the whole thing unwinds and the after-completeStep() code of each proxy step does the rollback/commit</span>
[18:51:27] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; perfect</span>
[18:51:40] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; what could possibly go wrong!</span>
[18:51:42] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; it's a bit more fine-grained though</span>
[18:51:55] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; the rules for rollback apply at different levels</span>
[18:52:16] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; yeah but since it's all a flat chain, the criteria can be shared among all the proxying step handlers equally</span>
[18:52:19] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; first the server itself, which is the same as what we see in standalone</span>
[18:52:39] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; then the server group</span>
[18:53:21] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; then whether one server group faiing results in all others rolling back</span>
[18:54:51] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; we can put all that logic into one class with methods like serverInGroupFailed, hostFailed, hostSucceeded, etc. and that instance can be passed to all the step handlers which proxy, and it can decide whether to trigger rollback</span>
[18:55:27] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; then for local server operations, the execution plan is, presumably, somewhat simpler</span>
[18:55:55] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; rollback-on-runtime-failure</span>

[18:56:15] <span class="a">*** ChanServ sets mode: +v frainone</span>
[18:56:38] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; should be fairly straightforward I think... the service verification handler can probably implement that automatically tbh</span>
[18:58:41] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; do we still have &quot;operation-headers&quot;, bstansberry?</span>
[18:58:57] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; looks like it's different depending on whether it's a composite op?</span>

[18:59:43] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; dmlloyd: yes, we have &quot;operation-headers&quot;</span>

[19:00:13] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; anything else we dream up would be in there</span>
[19:00:38] <span class="d">&lt;bstansberry&gt; e.g. a flag to say &quot;go ahead and execute in the runtime even though the server is restart-required</span>
[19:00:43] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; bstansberry: okay in the FormatOf... document it shows composite ops bypassing that</span>
[19:01:07] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; I assume that's an oversight?</span>
[19:01:23] <span class="a">*** Jaikiran has quit IRC</span>

[23:17:22] <span class="d">&lt;tdiesler&gt; dmlloyd, It generally raises the question whether MSC could detect that TCCL leak.</span>
[23:17:57] <span class="b">*** alexsmirnov has joined #jboss-as7</span>
[23:18:19] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; it can't, really, however I have an enhancement to clear TCCL after each service start/stop and listener invocation.</span>
[23:18:25] <span class="d">&lt;tdiesler&gt; dmlloyd, i.e. if a service sets the TCCL without resetting it - it leaks to the next service that happs to use the same thread</span>
[23:18:51] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; yeah TCCL leaks have caused a large number of problems so far.</span>
[23:18:58] <span class="d">&lt;tdiesler&gt; dmlloyd, is it not an error condition?</span>
[23:19:16] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; I don't think it can be defined as an error</span>
[23:19:29] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; but it is a pretty dumb thing to do :)</span>
[23:19:36] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; and pretty rude!</span>
[23:19:54] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; anyway if we clear it after each user task it should solve most issues</span>
[23:20:02] <span class="d">&lt;tdiesler&gt; dmlloyd, why not? if there is no TCCL before you call start - there should be none after you return from start</span>
[23:20:06] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; and we should probably configure our thread pools to do so</span>
[23:20:23] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; I can't guarantee that tdiesler, especially in the face of async service start/stop</span>
[23:21:38] <span class="d">&lt;tdiesler&gt; dmlloyd, I don't understand. There must be some code in msc that calls start, at this point you should not have a TCCL, right?</span>
[23:22:01] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; yeah you wouldn't, though we've talked about making the TCCL be equal to the service's class loader</span>
[23:22:10] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; which might be a desirable option</span>
[23:23:38] <span class="d">&lt;tdiesler&gt; dmlloyd, in my case its a 3rd party bug. It sets the TCCL to somthing other than the service's CL</span>
[23:24:07] <span class="d">&lt;tdiesler&gt; dmlloyd, in which case code that comes after it that assumes the service's CL would break</span>
[23:24:23] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; yeah I still think the solution is simply to clear the TCCL after each user task</span>
[23:24:45] <span class="d">&lt;dmlloyd&gt; the old TCP adage: be liberal in what you accept and strict in what you send</span>
