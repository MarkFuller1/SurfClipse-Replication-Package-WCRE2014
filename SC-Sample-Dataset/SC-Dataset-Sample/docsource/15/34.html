<h1 align="center">Handling network timeouts in Java</h1>

<p align="center"><em><font face="Arial" size="3">By David Reilly</font></em></p>
<div align="center"><center>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="90%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%" bgcolor="#FFF4DD">When writing network applications in a stable and
    controlled environment, it is easy to forget what the real world is like. Slow
    connections, traffic build ups, or power interruptions can cause network connections to
    stall or even die. Few programmers take the time to detect and handle network timeouts,
    but avoiding the problem can cause client applications to freeze, and for threads in
    servers to block indefinitely. There are, however, easy ways to handle network timeouts.
    In this article, I'll present two techniques for overcoming the problem of network
    timeouts - threads and setting a socket option for timeouts.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center></div>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Handling timeouts is one of those tasks that people generally leave to the last moment.
In an ideal world, we'd never need them. In an intranet environment, where most
programmers do their development, it's almost always unnecessary. However, on the
Internet, good timeout handling is critical. Badly behaved clients may go offline and
leaving server threads locked, or overloaded servers may stall, causing a network client
to block indefinitely for input. For these reasons, it is necessary to detect and handle
network timeouts.</p>

<p>I've identified two relatively simple solutions to the problem of handling network
timeouts. The first solution involves the use of second thread, which acts as a timer.
This solution results in a slight increase in complexity, but is backwards compatible with
JDK1.02. The second solution is by far, much simpler. It takes only a few lines of code,
by setting a socket option, and catching a timeout exception. The catch is, that it
requires a JDK1.1 or higher virtual machine. </p>

<h2>Solution One : Using a timer thread</h2>

<p>Many network software (particularly servers), are written as multi-threaded
applications. However, a client can also use multiple threads. One solution to handling
network timeouts is to launch a secondary thread, the 'timer', and have it cancel the
application gracefully if it becomes stalled. This prevents end users from becoming
confused when the application stalls - a good error message will at least let them know
the cause of the problem.</p>

<p>Listing One shows a Timer, which can be used in networking applications to handle
timeouts gracefully. Once the timer is started, it must be reset regularly, such as when
data is returned by a server. However, if the thread that reads from a remote network host
becomes stalled, the timer will exit with an error message. For those who require a custom
handler, the timeout() method may be overridden to provide different functionality.</p>

<pre>/** 
  * The Timer class allows a graceful exit when an application
  * is stalled due to a networking timeout. Once the timer is
  * set, it must be cleared via the reset() method, or the
  * timeout() method is called.
  * &lt;p&gt;
  * The timeout length is customizable, by changing the 'length'
  * property, or through the constructor. The length represents
  * the length of the timer in milliseconds.

public class Timer extends Thread
{
	/** Rate at which timer is checked */
	protected int m_rate = 100;
	
	/** Length of timeout */
	private int m_length;

	/** Time elapsed */
	private int m_elapsed;

	/**
	  * Creates a timer of a specified length
	  * @param	length	Length of time before timeout occurs
	  */
	public Timer ( int length )
	{
		// Assign to member variable
		m_length = length;

		// Set time elapsed
		m_elapsed = 0;
	}

	
	/** Resets the timer back to zero */
	public synchronized void reset()
	{
		m_elapsed = 0;
	}

	/** Performs timer specific code */
	public void run()
	{
		// Keep looping
		for (;;)
		{
			// Put the timer to sleep
			try
			{ 
				Thread.sleep(m_rate);
			}
			catch (InterruptedException ioe) 
			{
				continue;
			}

			// Use 'synchronized' to prevent conflicts
			synchronized ( this )
			{
				// Increment time remaining
				m_elapsed += m_rate;

				// Check to see if the time has been exceeded
				if (m_elapsed &gt; m_length)
				{
					// Trigger a timeout
					timeout();
				}
			}

		}
	}

	// Override this to provide custom functionality
	public void timeout()
	{
		System.err.println (&quot;Network timeout occurred.... terminating&quot;);
		System.exit(1);
	}
}</pre>

<hr>

<p>To illustrate the use of the Timer class, here is a simple TCP client (Listing Two) and
server (Listing Three). The client sends a text string across the network, and then reads
a response. While reading, it would become blocked if the server stalled, or if the server
took too long to accept the connection. For this reason, a timer is started before
connecting, and then reset after each major operation. Starting the timer is relatively
simple, but it must be reset after each blocking operation or the client will terminate.</p>

<pre>// Start timer
Timer timer = new Timer(3000);
timer.start();

// Perform some read operation
......

// Reset the timer
timer.reset();</pre>

<p>The server is relatively simple - it's a single-threaded application, which simulates a
stalled server. The server reads a response from the client, and echoes it back.To
demonstrate timeouts, the server will always &quot;stall&quot; for a period of twenty
seconds, on every second connection. Remember though, in real life, server timeouts are
entirely unpredictable, and will not always correct themselves after several seconds of
delay.</p>

<h2>Solution Two : Simplified timeout handling with socket options</h2>

<p>A significantly easier solution to handling network timeouts is to set a socket option.
Socket options allow programmers greater control over socket communication, and are
supported by Java as of JDK1.1. One socket option in particular, SO_TIMEOUT, is extremely
useful, because it allows programmers to specify an amount of time that a read operation
will block for, before generating an <em>java.io.InterruptedIOException</em>, which can be
easily caught to provide a timeout handler.</p>

<p>We can specify a value for SO_TIMEOUT, by using the setSoTimeout() method. This method
is supported by <em>java.net.Socket</em>, <em>java.net.DatagramSocket</em>, and <em>java.net.ServerSocket</em>.
This is important, as it means we can handle timeouts in both the client and the server.
The setSoTimeout accepts as its sole parameter an <em>int</em>, which represents the
number of milliseconds an operation may block for. Settings this value to one thousand
will result in timeouts after one second of inactivity, whereas setting SO_TIMEOUT to zero
will allow the thread to block indefinitely.</p>

<pre>// Set SO_TIMEOUT for five seconds
MyServerSocket.setSoTimeout(5000);</pre>

<p>Once the length for the timeout is set, any blocking operation will cause an
InterruptedIOException to be thrown. For example, a DatagramSocket that failed to receive
packets when the receive() method is called, would throw an exception. This makes it easy
to separate our timeout handling code from the task of communicating via the network.</p>

<p>The next example, Listing Four, shows another multi-threaded echo server with timeout
support. It limits the number of connections it can support (currently set to two), and
rejects further connections. However, if a client fails to send data, a server thread will
become blocked, and the number of available connections will be reduced. With larger
servers, and hundreds or thousands of connections per hour, blocked threads become a
significant problem, and can lead to denial of service. This example shows how to detect a
timeout, and to disconnect gracefully. By using socket_options, and catching exceptions,
it's easier to shut down an individual thread.</p>

<p>To test the echo server, you can use the telnet command (available on both Unix/Wintel
systems), and connect to port 2000 of your local machine. Type a few characters of text,
and then watch what happens after thirty seconds of inactivity. The server will
automatically disconnect the telnet client, freeing up the connection for another user.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>All good network applications will include timeout detection and handling. Whether
you're writing a client, and need to detect a wayward server, or writing a server and need
to prevent stalled connections, timeout handling is a critical part of error handling. For
those who require backwards compatibility with JDK1.02, timers may be used to detect
stalled connections. The most preferable solution though, is to use socket options, and to
provide an exception handler for <em>java.io.InterruptedIOException</em>. This reduces the
amount of code required to handle timeouts, and makes for a cleaner design.</p>
