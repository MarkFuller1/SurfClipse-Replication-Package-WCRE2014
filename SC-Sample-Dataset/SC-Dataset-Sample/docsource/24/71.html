&gt; Subject: Ganymede
&gt; Date: Tue, 13 Jul 1999 11:47:04 -0600
&gt; 
&gt; Hi Jon, I am consultant for ATCO I-tek formally know as Canadian Utilities
&gt; (CU).  We have Ganymede running on our infrastructure here and was setup by
&gt; a person of the name Curtis King.  I am getting a error message when I try
&gt; and run the Ganymede GUI.  Keep in mind that the GUI has been working well
&gt; and just stopped on Friday July 13th.

Friday, July 9th?

&gt; The error message is as follows:
&gt; RMI: Couldn't bind to server object java.rmi.NotBoundException:
&gt; ganymede.server

What this indicates is that the client was able to talk to the RMI
registry on the machine running the Ganymede server, but that the
RMI registry doesn't know about any 'ganymede.server' object, which
is the name that the Ganymede server uses to register itself with
RMI.

I would expect to see this if the Ganymede server was killed, or if the RMI
registry process was killed and restarted.

You can also see this if you are running the RMI registry for Ganymede on a
non-standard port and the client hasn't been configured to look on the actual
port used for RMI, and winds up talking to an RMI registry process installed
to service a different RMI server (Sun's SIMS mail server uses its own
RMI registry process, which won't run properly on a system with Ganymede
unless Ganymede is configured to use an alternate port for the RMI
registry)..

This sort of exception might also be thrown if the RMI registry was aware of a
bound ganymede.server object, but for some reason the RMI registry and/or
client believes that the class files for the server are not compatible with
those included in the client's ganymede.jar file.

&gt; I looked through you discussion list for similar error messages or bug
&gt; reports found some rmi stuff but I do not think it is the same as what I
&gt; have happening here.
&gt; 
&gt; Things tried thus far
&gt; Server:  Restarted Ganymede server: NIS; inetd; named; anything that might
&gt; be related to this error message.
&gt; We ended up doing a reboot of this server and still did not work.

That's very strange, then... rebooting the system and restarting the Ganymede
server with runServer should have restarted both the RMI registry and the
Ganymede server.  I would have to lean on having incompatible versions
of the client and server then..

I did release Ganymede 0.99.4 on Friday.. perhaps someone updated the server
or client without updating both?  Note that the installClient process for
0.99.4 no longer installs the web-access files as part of the client's
directory structure, so if you installed 0.99.4 on top of an earlier client
install directory, the html directory would not have been updated, and would
still have the old version of the client jar files in place.

&gt; Client trying to run the GUI on:
&gt; Restarted the same process as above.  The only difference is that we have
&gt; yet to reboot the server.  Chances are that after the reboot everything will
&gt; go back in order and work again.  But I would like to understand why this
&gt; happened.  
&gt; 
&gt; One thing I read about is that the rmiregistry and the ganymede server are
&gt; not in sync, but when I restart the ganymede server they should sync up
&gt; correctly.
&gt; 
&gt; Could you point me in the right direction and shed some insight to this
&gt; problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for your time on this matter.
&gt; 
&gt; Take care
&gt; 	Darrell
