                <div class="post-content">
                	<p>The most recent project I have been working on involved creating a large number of reports for the company&#8217;s extranet/intranet. In the past, I have usually done reports using some form of JSP and JDBC. But in this case, there is a large number of reports to be developed, and so I was tasked with researching some of the open source solutions for reporting, in hopes we could find a solution that would allow us to get the reports done faster, and be provided to the user with more functionality, and with less custom code.</p>
<p>In the end we compared Crystal reports with <a href="http://jasperreports.sourceforge.net/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://jasperreports.sourceforge.net']);">JasperReports</a>, and JasperReports was picked. JasperReports is not only free, but also is proven in the Java world, and has a lot of users. It is customizable, since its Java and open source, and has support for using Collections or Lists of Business Objects, such as those populated via Hibernate.</p>
<p><span id="more-7"></span></p>
<p>Once JasperReports was chosen, I tested several GUI&#8217;s to help build the reports instead of editing them strictly in their native XML. <a href="http://www.jasperassistant.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.jasperassistant.com']);">JasperAssistant</a> was found to be the best of all of them, and integrates seamlessly with Eclipse. If you are an Eclipse fan as I am, then you&#8217;ll love using JasperAssistant. It even allows you to preview the report against your database right in Eclipse.</p>
<p>Next, I looked into <a href="http://opensourcesoft.net/index.php" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://opensourcesoft.net']);">OpenReports</a>. OpenReports is a front end for JasperReports. It was written in WebWork, and provides a lot of functionality that you would have to write yourself to get the reports running on the web. It comes with basic security (users, passwords, and reporting groups). You can assign which users can access which groups, and which reports are in which groups. You can also add parameters, and then assign them to a report. You create the JasperReport in JasperAssistant (or with any other tool, including a text editor if you want to do the XML by hand), and then compile it (which JasperAssistant does for you). Then when you add a new report to OpenReports, you select which JasperReport file to use, select your datasource, assign your parameters and the report is ready to be used on the web.</p>
<p>OpenReports allows the user to export the report as a PDF, HTML, CSV, XLS, or PNG. This is all done for you without any additional work. As for parameters, there is some good functionality built in. When you add a Date parameter to your report, it automatically brings up a calendar for the user to select the date with. Also, you can add a query parameter which runs an sql that you have specified, and populates a drop down select box with the results. Parameters can be marked as required or optional, can be several different data types, and can be told to come in in any order needed. There are other parameter options as well. It also allows the user to schedule a report and have it emailed to a user.</p>
<p>I have made some improvements to OpenReports, including the Collection/List functionality to use Business Objects which JasperReports supports, but OpenReports currently doesn&#8217;t. At some point I&#8217;ll pass that code on to the original developers.</p>
<p>In the end, with JasperReports and OpenReports, the only thing you have to worry about is creating the SQL to get the data. After that, it takes little work to provide a nice looking report in multiple formats on a web site.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-4" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I found them to be very easy to install. The learning curve is in learning how to use JasperAssistant. Not because JasperAssistant is difficult, but because you have to learn Jasper Reports and and how banding, and grouping and such works. If you happen to have Crystal experience, it won&#8217;t take as much time, but I didn&#8217;t. Installing them is trivial.</p>
<p>I have not used them from within Cocoon. Jasper Reports should be easy to use from within Cocoon, but I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;d be able to use Open Reports from within Cocoon. It is its own separate web application. We are keeping it separated from our intranet/extranet, and just linking to it (and integrated the security between the two). It uses WebWork as a web framework. The time to port that to Cocoon would be massive.</p>
<p>Good luck with setup, and let me know if you have any other questions.</p>

<p>I have feel question as follow about the development flow and system architecture. My project have 2 type of report (Adhoc, Batch)</p>
<p>1. JasperAssistant is it better then Open Report Designer?<br />
2. If I use JasperAssistant create a report within my Application? How can I deploy the report to Open Report?<br />
3. Currently I have use WAS as Application Server, Can I use JBoss &amp; Open Report as Reporting Server?</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-6" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>1. If I recall correctly, Open Report Designer did not allow filling a report with data from a Collection of business objects, which JasperAssistant did. Also, since I&#8217;m a huge fan of Eclipse, I very much enjoy having my Jasper report designer be fully integrated with Eclipse.</p>
<p>2. I have the open report web application as a project in Eclpse. The reports are in a reports folder in the web application. I just double click on them in Eclipse, and edit them. Then you can use deploy them however you normally would from eclipse (personally, I use the MyEclipse plugin for web app deployment).</p>
<p>3. Open Reports is a web appliation that should work with any application server, including WAS, Tomcat, JBoss, etc.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-8" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Jasper Reports is the reporting engine. Open Reports is a web gui front end for that engine, and Hibernate is an &#8220;object/relational persistence and query service for Java&#8221;.</p>
<p>Jasper Reports can fill a report from a Collection of Business Objects, which were filled with data from a relational database via Hibernate. Open Reports is a web gui which allows users to select a report, enter parameters for a report, and then schedule to report to be run, or run the report in real time, and view the results in PDF, HTML, CSV, etc.</p>
<p>All three work together to provide a wonderful reporting solution for a Java environment. You can do without the Hibernate if you don&#8217;t need to fill the report from business objects, and just use standard JDBC to fill the reports.</p>

<p>I will only make 2 annotation to the previous postings &#8230;</p>
<p>To posting 3, about how to deploy the Reports &#8230; in OpenReports there is the possibility to upload the JasperReport-Templates (not the xml, but the precompiled templates) into the configured directory which stores the JasperReport-Files &#8230;</p>
<p>So if, like in my case, the &#8220;OpenReport-Server&#8221; is located on another machine, thats no problem, you can just upload the compiled reports over the OpenReports-Interface and than use them to show your Reports :-).</p>
<p>The second is the hint to iReport &#8230; it&#8217;s a GUI for creating JasperReport-Templates too &#8230; is easy to use and nearly uptodate with the current JasperReport-Version &#8230;<br />
It&#8217;s a standalone-java-application so that someone who don&#8217;t use eclipse could use iReport without any other software (except java of course).<br />
It&#8217;s also possible to bind the Template at the develop-time to several DataSources like any relational database with jdbc-support, JavaBeans, xml- and csv-files and show the filled report in all the possible output-formats (pdf, html, csv, excel and in the JRViewer itself &#8230;).</p>
<p>So i use iReport since a while and i think thats a realy nice program to create the needed templates to use in OpenReports (or whatelse programm ;-).</p>
<p>Have a nice day &#8230;<br />

<p>I prefer Open Report Designer (ORD) than JasperAssistant because ORD is a standalone solution.<br />
ORD is not intrusive in Jasper template than iReport.</p>
<p>To improve Jasper and ORDesigner I want to use Jasper with Hibernate, and manipulate UML model.</p>

Yes, I did read the [minimal] installation guide (as I mentioned in my previous post) and worked through all the steps.  The point was that then nothing happened, and its not clear at all what additional steps are required to have a complete application running under Tomcat.  Perhaps you could write up some of the &#8220;missing steps&#8221; and post them on a blog.  Failing which, where else can I look for more detailed information?</p>

It allows you to use a WYSIWYG interface for laying out the report. It produces a compiled file with a .jasper extension, which is what you use in the Open Reports web engine to setup the usage of that report with an interface. I do not have the administractio guide, either, but setting up the interface portion of a report is very easy. However, using the ORD may be more complex and I have no experience with that.</p>

It then creates the HTML or the PDF, or whatever your export type is, and ensures that export type looks like you&#8217;ve described in the Jasper XML. All the GUI&#8217;s like JasperAssistant and iReport, allow the user to describe the look. CSS is used by Jasper in the HTML it creates, but changing that would be counter to how Jasper is designed.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m writing a Swing based desktop application that needs to produce a 10 page PDF document.  The document is composed of various sections containing paragraphs of text from various different datasources.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried to produce the document using Jasper and iReport, however I&#8217;m reaching the conclusion that the format of my document is too complex for Jasper/iReport.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve constructed various custom datasource classes that implement the JRDataSource interface to return the contents of the various sections within the document.  In iReport, I&#8217;ve created a collection of subreports for each of the different sections.  Each subreport is associated with a custom datasource.</p>
<p>The problem I&#8217;m experiencing is that the layout of the resultant PDF does not reflect what I&#8217;ve designed in iReport.  The subreports appear overlapped instead of appearing in the sequence I&#8217;ve designed in iReport.  I&#8217;ll need to produce about 8 of these subreports for the entire document.</p>
<p>Do you think its possible to produce this type of multiple page documet with various subsections using Jasper/iReport or is this too complex?  Would JasperAssistant be more suitable?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thinking maybe I should be using a framework like iText?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

You are correct to use subreports in your situation, but I&#8217;m surprised that it isn&#8217;t coming out the same as you design. So far, with the 35+ reports we&#8217;ve done with Jasper using JasperAssistant, they have all come out looking exactly as we have designed them. The PDF version is exact, while the HTML is a little off, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s to be expected.</p>
<p>Before using Jasper, I created a report with iText, and it did work, but it was more time consuming than creating a report with JasperAssistant.</p>
<p>I believe iText is used by Jasper, but if you use just iText alone, you may run into some problems when you want to do parts of a form that grow. I don&#8217;t believe iText is very good for that. When I came across the requirement to have dyanamic reports as opposed to a form that could be filled out, I had to move from iText to Jasper.</p>

It works like a dream because both reporting methods use bands and it is only a matter of converting the band scaling between the two types of reports.  The SQL to drive the report is simply inserted into the XML.</p>
<p>The problem I have found is in the use of American date format in Open Reports but I am sure that this can be solved.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-34" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>A few of the reports I had to create, required a form of cross tab reporting. So I created a framework within Open Reports to accomplish this. It is report specific, but is very simple to implement per report. It works on the premise that Jasper can populate the report from a Collection of objects. So instead of populating from a JDBC results set, a CrosstabAction is used to convert the JDBC result set into a generic Collection which the Jasper report uses to fill itself. The Action reverses the data from column to row, or  performs any other type of &#8220;rearrangement&#8221; of the data that you may need to do that can&#8217;t be done via SQL. We have used it now for two reports and once I figured out the idea and the framework in the first report, the second report only took a few minutes to implement.</p>

I am using Jasper Reports for my current project. Things are working fine except for one thing.<br />
When i generate a Jasper Report, it opens up on the server not on the client.<br />
Please tell me what I need to do to open up a Jasper Report on the client.<br />
Right now it is opening up in the server, I need to open it on the client.<br />
My code is as follows:</p>
<p>JasperDesign gratuityReportDesign = JasperManager.loadXmlDesign (&#8220;../server/default/deploy/reports/GratuityConsoleReport.jrxml&#8221;);</p>
<p>JasperReport gratuityJasperReport = JasperManager.compileReport (gratuityReportDesign);</p>
<p>Map parameters = new HashMap ();</p>
<p>parameters.put (&#8220;Title&#8221;, &#8220;Gratuity Report&#8221;);</p>
<p>parameters.put (&#8220;FromDate&#8221;, ( (GratuityConsoleInputDataVO) data )<br />
                            .getFromDate ());</p>
<p>parameters.put (&#8220;ToDate&#8221;, ( (GratuityConsoleInputDataVO) data )<br />
                            .getToDate ());</p>
<p>parameters.put (&#8220;LOGO&#8221;,<br />
&#8220;../server/default/deploy/reports/logo.jpg&#8221;);</p>
<p>conn = DataAccessUtil.getConnection ();</p>
<p>JasperPrint jasperPrint = JasperManager<br />
.fillReport (gratuityJasperReport, parameters, conn);</p>
<p>JasperViewer jasperViewer = new JasperViewer (jasperPrint, false);</p>
<p>jasperViewer.show ();</p>
<p>This code opens the report on the server. Please tell me how to open it on the client.</p>
<p>Thanks alot<br />

<p>We need a mechanism for users to 1) define this group of parameters 2) save the instance parameter values in the database 3) pull up this instance (predefined values of parameters) from the database.  This feature would allow users to avoid specifying parameter values every time through the UI.</p>
<p>The workaround is to save every instance as a separate report file.  But this solution isn&#8217;t scalable when targeting an ASP market.</p>

<p>The second method would be to alter the jasper report xml based on your critera, then compile it and run it. I do a lot of xml creation, so that part of it I don&#8217;t have a problem with.

I need to export reports to PDF and CSV/EXCEL formats. I am able to successfully export reports to all three format(with same jasper print object) the only problem is the export includes page elements that are not really relevant to the format.</p>
<p>For example, if you I create a report with a footer that contians page numbers and fill/export the report to PDF I generate a nice paginated report with page numbers at the bottom. If I fill/export to EXCEL I get EXCEL that is paginated with page numbers at what would be the bottom of the page only all of this is on one  page. If I fill/export to CSV I get comma delimited rows that are again paginated and page numbers at what would be the bottom of the page. This makes no sense from a semantic point of view. The purpose of exporting to CSV would be to provide the detail of the report in tabular format for conversion into another format, like Excel. You don&#8217;t care about page numbers nor do you want them.</p>
<p>So, I was wondering if anyone else has had this same problem and created a workaround. If so, what was the workaround?</p>

<p>When I first did an export to CSV/Excel I was just as surprised as you were about the result. And to my knowledge, there is nothing you can do about, other, than to add in a suppression expression for every element you wouldn&#8217;t want in the CSV/Excel (which I think is way too much work). But, keep one thing in mind before you label this a bug. JasperReports is not a database tool. It is a reporting tool. All the XML that describes a Jasper Report would be worthless if all you wanted was a data dump from an SQL statement.</p>
<p>That can be done so easily without JasperReports, that it really makes no sense to use a reporting engine for a simple dump like that. I&#8217;m not sure who uses the CSV/Excel versions, as they strike me as very useless, but once I remembered what the point of Jasper Reports is, it didn&#8217;t surprise me as much.</p>

 To build jasper for reports that have dynamic columns, i am building the jasper using java code.But if the value is null its throwing,<br />
net.sf.jasperreports.engine.fill.JRExpressionEvalException: Error evaluating expression : null<br />
	Source text : $F{col8}<br />
	at net.sf.jasperreports.engine.fill.JRCalculator.evaluate(JRCalculator.java:407)</p>
<p>but the same design works with non null values data.</p>
<p>This is the code thru which i build detail part.<br />
 public static JRDesignTextField buildTextField(Class clazz, int xcorod,<br />
            int ycoord, int width, int height, JRFont fontType, String fieldName) {<br />
        JRDesignTextField textField = new JRDesignTextField();<br />
        textField.setBlankWhenNull(true);<br />
        textField.setStretchWithOverflow(true);<br />
        textField.setX(xcorod);<br />
        textField.setY(ycoord);<br />
        textField.setWidth(width);<br />
        textField.setHeight(height);<br />
        textField.setTextAlignment(JRTextElement.TEXT_ALIGN_RIGHT);<br />

        JRDesignExpression expression = new JRDesignExpression();<br />
        expression.setText(&#8220;$F{&#8221; + fieldName + &#8220;}&#8221;);<br />
        expression.setValueClass(clazz);<br />
        textField.setExpression(expression);<br />
        return textField;</p>

<p>Kindly let me know where the problem is..<br />

<p>If you want to paginate in HTML, there is a parameter in Jasper using the JRHtmlExporter class, that basically sets the number of the page to visualize inside the browser, your code only have to set this number properly when the action is called with the &#8216;next&#8217; button, like in the following code snippet:</p>
<p><code><br />
JRHtmlExporter exporter = new JRHtmlExporter();<br />
...<br />
exporter.setParameter(JRExporterParameter.PAGE_INDEX, new Integer(pageIndex));<br />
...<br />
exporter.exportReport();<br />
</code></p>
<p>Hope it helps.<br />
Cheers.</p>

<p>The compiler will certainly let you know if you have wrongly marked a method static. You don&#8217;t have to worry that if it compiled and ran as static, that you shouldn&#8217;t have marked it static.</p>
<p>Best to read some existing information on the net about when to use static. For example:<br />
<a href="http://www.artima.com/designtechniques/staticP.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-comment','http://www.artima.com']);" rel="nofollow">http://www.artima.com/designtechniques/staticP.html</a></p>

<p>Hi all,<br />
Is it possible to use a field value as input to a localized resource value.</p>
<p>I have a code coming from the database $F{CODE}.</p>
<p>I want to retrieve the resource bundle value for this code using something like $R{CODE} or $R{$F{CODE}, but neither seems to work.</p>
<p>Has anyone managed to do something similar ?</p>

In doing this you then have the ability to tell the browser that the response content is an attachment (causing it to open in another window).</p>
<p>Like so:<br />
response.setHeader(&#8220;Content-Disposition &#8220;, &#8220;attachment; filename=&#8221;+theFileName);</p>
<p>using the filename, your client should be able to open/save the report using a more friendlier filename rather than the page name (which would be the default).</p>
<p>Does anybody know how to tell when a generated report contains no data before sending it to the client?</p>

     I have been using jasperreports for some time now.<br />
I am facing some problems while designing my report.<br />
1. My report has varied no.of columns i.e. it could contain 2,3 or 4 columns. I cant figure out as how to adjust the no.of columns dynamically within the same page width.<br />
Say, if my page width is x, then x should be sum of either c1+c2 or c1+c2+c3 or c1+c2+c3+c4.<br />
2. Second problem is a similar one, only difference would be that the no.of columns is fixed i.e but their width is supposed to the varied.<br />
3. Finally, 2 sets of data to be displayed in MainHeaderGroupFooter, with varying no.of rows.<br />
Now if I give a fixed height, both these overlap.</p>
<p>Your help is much appreciated.<br />
Regards,<br />
Dev</p>

<p>To do a like statement using a parameter you have to do it like this:<br />
like $P{INVENTARIO} + &#8216;%&#8217;</p>
<p>This should work.</p>

I don&#8217;t recall having to do anything. When you unzip the download, there is a WebRoot folder. The contents of that is your web app. If you just copy the WebRoot directory to your $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps directory and rename it to openreports, you should then be able to go to your url/openreports/ and see the basic openreports come up. There are some settings to set the correct path to where you will put the reports, but at lesat you should see it running very quickly.</p>

Did you follow all the steps for setting up the database? The install guide lists out all these steps, and that error you are getting seems to imply that you don&#8217;t have the tables its looking for.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t yet used Jasper built in crosstab features. When I began using Jasper there was no crosstab, so I wrote my own. What I did was so simple that we have continued to use it. Its so quick to do what we need. One day I&#8217;ll sit down with Jasper&#8217;s solution and see which I like best.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not really sure what print dialog you are looking for. Are you using a graphical interface like JasperAssistant, or are you running a report from within Tomcat? Any report you want to print from within Tomcat would use your browsers print functionality.</p>

I was never able to call an oracle stored procedure, but I was able to call an Oracle stored function. Once you&#8217;ve written the stored function, calling it is exactly like a regular select, which is why it works ok in Jasper. So for example, you would call it like this:<br />

<p>You said you could use the Oracle functions in Jasper reeports.<br />
I am trying to do the same but in vain.<br />
I have a function which returns 2 values, so I have followed u r example and trying the sql as:<br />
SELECT dayeRemaining, totalDays FROM table (FN_CALCULATE_DAYS ())</p>
<p>but it throws an exception saying<br />
java.sql.SQLException: ORA-22905: cannot access rows from a non-nested table item</p>
<p>Any suggestions please.</p>

subject: Custom Datasource &#8211; Subreports<br />
situation: The master report uses a JRDataSource (say MasterDS) with fieldA and fieldB. While filling the master report, the MasterDS also fills a bean which must serve as a custom datasource for a subreport with fieldC. This subreport is called in the report Summary . problem: It&#8217;s strange but when running, Jasper needs getFieldA() and getFieldB() in the bean although these fields are not needed in the subreport.First I&#8217;ve tried to use a second JRDataSource instead of a bean but with the same result.<br />
Questioin: Is there some way to use multiple total independant datasources within the same report-subreport. If so, please any hint would be welcome as this whole thing keeps me busy for 2 days.</p>
<p>Thanks and have a nice day,</p>
<p>Rose</p>

<p>You cannot call a stored procedure from a jasper report, since stored procedures do not return standard result sets (at least in most databases, there may be some exceptions).</p>
<p>However, I know you can in Oracle call a stored function, which can be made to return a standard result set. I hope to be writing up some instructions on how to do this over the next week.</p>

<p>Can you explain what you are trying to do? My experience with JasperReports is all web based, and in that situation, the server returns a PDF, HTML, or whatever file you request to the user&#8217;s browser. The printing is then handled by the browser. Are you working with a web application or a desktop application?</p>

<p>You must pass your ArrayList of object to jasper as a JRBeanCollectionDataSource:<br />
<code><br />
JRBeanCollectionDataSource ds = new JRBeanCollectionDataSource(list);<br />
jasperPrint = JasperFillManager.fillReport(jr, reportParameters, ds);<br />
</code><br />
Then in the JasperReport you refer to the object&#8217;s properties or methods, in an OGNL type manner. For example, to access the name property of an employee object within list objects, use:<br />
<code><br />
employee.name<br />
</code><br />
OR to reference a property called name within the list objects:<br />
<code><br />
name<br />
</code></p>

127. by Brian Burridge, @ May 26th, 2006</p>
<p>I am doing a research for using Jasper with stored procedures. Here are some ideas:</p>
<p>1. JavaBeans datasource could be used instead of queries. You can fill JavaBeans objects external to jasper calling stored procedures and pass this to jasper xml templates. Hibernate/Jasper integration is using it. For example:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/wakaleo/?anchor=using_hibernate_queries_with_jasperreports" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-comment','http://www.jroller.com']);" rel="nofollow">http://www.jroller.com/page/wakaleo/?anchor=using_hibernate_queries_with_jasperreports</a></p>
<p>2. There is something written in the &#8216;JasperReports Ultimate Guide&#8217; <a href="http://jasperreports.sourceforge.net/more.docs.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-comment','http://jasperreports.sourceforge.net']);" rel="nofollow">http://jasperreports.sourceforge.net/more.docs.html</a> you can see table of contents 9.4.2</p>
<p>The problem is you have to pay to see the content. I didn&#8217;t buy it yet.</p>

<p>In our (jakarta-based) jsp, we&#8217;ve compiled and exported our ResultSet data to pdf via:</p>
<p>JRPdfExporter exporter = new JRPdfExporter();<br />
ByteArrayOutputStream pdfReport = new ByteArrayOutputStream();<br />
exporter.setParameter(JRExporterParameter.JASPER_PRINT, jasperPrint);<br />
exporter.setParameter(JRExporterParameter.OUTPUT_STREAM, pdfReport);<br />
exporter.exportReport();</p>
<p>Things seem to be okay to this point.</p>
<p>However, we&#8217;re trying to then display this exported pdf info in browser window via:</p>
<p>byte[] pdfasbytes = pdfReport.toByteArray();<br />
response.setContentType(&#8220;application/pdf&#8221;);<br />
response.setContentLength(pdfasbytes.length);<br />
ServletOutputStream ouputStream = response.getOutputStream();<br />
ouputStream.write(pdfasbytes, 0, pdfasbytes.length);<br />
ouputStream.flush();<br />
ouputStream.close();</p>
<p>What we&#8217;re getting, though, looks like:<br />
%PDF-1.4 %?3 0 obj stream x???]O??,????????B???4&#8243;.??i??m? q@&#8217;1?HZ?I?d????`????X???g?%1?{/??_??]</p>

<p>Have you checked to be sure your jasperPrint has some pages?<br />
jasperPrint.getPages().size()</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t use the JRPdfExporter. After I have filled the jasperPrint (which I&#8217;m assuming you already did before the code you pasted), I then:<br />
byte[] pdfByteArray = JasperExportManager.exportReportToPdf(jasperPrint);</p>
<p>Then I set the content type and length like you are. I also set the header ( I think IE needed this?):<br />
response.setHeader(&#8220;Content-disposition&#8221;, &#8220;inline; filename=report.pdf&#8221;);</p>
<p>Then:<br />
ServletOutputStream out = response.getOutputStream();<br />
out.write(pdfByteArray, 0, pdfByteArray.length);</p>
<p>out.flush();</p>
<p>out.close()</p>

<p>If it is unknown at design time, then it&#8217;s unknown at report compile time. So what you are asking is how to create dynamic JasperReports that you can compile at runtime. I believe there is a way to build JasperReports dynamically in Java, but I have never done it.</p>

<p>Ideally, you would pass the &#8216;filter&#8217; to your sql and only return the rows you need. The other option, is on your Detail band, there is a property called &#8216;printWhenExpression&#8217;. You can put an expression in there which when evaluated to true will print that detail row and when false will suppress it. For example:<br />
new Boolean($V{PAGE_NUMBER}.intValue() >)</p>

<p>Thanks for the article:</p>
<p>you end the article by saying, and I quote:<br />
&#8220;In the end, with JasperReports and OpenReports, the only thing you have to worry about is creating the SQL to get the data. After that, it takes little work to provide a nice looking report in multiple formats on a web site&#8221;</p>
<p>So Are you meaning that the best way, easiest and fastest, is to use OpenReports !?<br />
That you only need to download openreports and nothing else ?<br />
If not so, do you mean that the &#8216;JasperAssistant&#8217; is as easy to use as OpenReports ?</p>
<p>I have never been in contact with a reporting system before, but seeing the benefit when coming in contact with openreports instead of having to write everything else in j2ee.</p>
<p>regards, i<br />
are these reports socalled crystal reports ( if I talk Oracle) ?</p>

What I was referring to, was the combination of JasperReports, OpenReports and JasperAssistant. JasperReports is the most important element, but OpenReports allows you to present the user with a full Web GUI to the reports, without writing code. JasperAssistant allows you to edit the reports with a GUI. So the combination leaves you to simply write SQL, and learn how to use JasperReports and you can create reports in no time.</p>
<p>JasperReports are designed like Crystal Reports, as far as how the reports are designed.</p>

I am a software engineer. My company makes a stand alone application. I introduced them to Jasper and implemented it. In the coming future ie. around 2007 we intend to take our application to the web. This would involve a huge effort and we would also want to be able to present our reports over the web. In kind of getting prepared for that I stumbled on open reports which sounds promising. Now the issue.</p>
<p>Our jasperreports do not connect to the database. We supply it with Java&#8217;s business objects and it reads them to populate the report. Can open reports accept these objects like an arrayList, hashmap or vector ? It seems from your blog that it cannot and it seems you changed the code of open reports to do so. If so, I do not want to reinvent the wheel and was wondering if you could provide me with your version of open reports. Please confirm my suspicions, thanks for your time.</p>

<p>I just need to export the detail section of my reports (not title, images, lines between rows, foot section, etc.) The exported sheet should be simple and ready for work.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard selective export is a weak point of JRreport. You have to export the whole report, getting a complex sheet full of empty narrow cols to preserve coordinates of non-relevant elements (images, corporative information, decorative lines, etc.) I suppose exporting as CVS is affected by similar limitations&#8230;</p>
<p>Do you think this is a real problem?<br />

JasperReports should not be viewed as an export tool. But, if you are using it anyway for reports, and you want the same data you are using in a report, to be exported in XLS, then certainly it will work. I added a type parameter that was passed to all reports, and I added a print when expression to all fields in the jasper report for that type when it was XSL. This way I can suppress all the headers, groups, etc, and only export the detail records.</p>

But now we have to develop a lot of reports and i already made some reports using jasper report (iRepor). When i generate a Jasper Report, it opens up on the server (in Jasper Viewer) not on the client and after generating the report the tomcat goes to be hang.<br />
Please tell me what I need to do to open up a Jasper Report on the client.<br />
Right now it is opening up in the server, I need to open it on the client.</p>

Any ideas?</p>

<p>Have you tried working with the Velocity templates? I&#8217;m drowning at the moment &#8211; I got OpenReports up and running and it is displaying reports via Stored Procs. Now I need to add drill-down reports with Velocity it seems, but I can&#8217;t upload the .vm files &#8211; do I need to precompile them somehow? I can&#8217;t even seem to upload normal .jasper files &#8211; I&#8217;m using v2.2 of OpenReports and v1.3.0 of iReports to compile my JasperReports.</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
Thanks!</p>

<p>am using jasper report for my report generation functionality.Am not using a query to retrieve the data from database, instead i will get recordzs as a list which i will assign to a JRBeanDataSource Object and pass it to<br />
JasperFillManager.fillReport method . My problem is that my each record from the list should come in seperate PDF pages. Curently what happens is that , there is no page break ,the report is a big strip of PDF with all records in one page in a one another below manner. Am not using JRXML file but instead am using a *.vm file for the creating  a report template.<br />
 do you have any idea which may be helpful to me?<br />
I can send you my files that am currently working on if needed.<br />
please do reply</p>
<p>Thanks<br />

<p>Sorry for the long delay, got sucked into another project. I created a very basic .vm file where I only rename the column headers. I am uploading the file from my pc to the server (into the Base Directory). I retrieve my data via a stored proc (mssql2000). I do not have any JasperReport files there. I can see the file in the dropdown box when I create a new report, but when trying to access the report, I get a resource not found exception.</p>

I am using the connection expression: $P{REPORT_CONNECTION} and am passing 2 parameters.  As I said, within iReports, the appropriate data is retrieved and displayed.  But when I execute the report within the web application, no records are retrieved / displayed.  I know that the subreport is being found because, to debug, I added a display of the parameters that are being passed and they are displaying accurately.  But the detail of the subreport remains blank, which makes me think that the query in the subreport is not being executed.  Any clues to a solution would be appreciated.  Thanks.</p>

<p>Hello, I came across a problem. I could display my report in applet which I have created with iReport tool. The problem is at the time of printing on the client machine,an error dialog box appears with message &#8220;Error In Printing&#8221;. I have to configure my java.policy file with some extra code for printing permission. So this has become a problem. If I give this report online how can I configure infinite clients on the web for pritning the report. Is there any other way to do so without configuring the java.policy file in the client machine?</p>
<p>Please Help..</p>
<p>Thanks in Advance</p>

<p>I have read some of your postings, very helpful, I have a question here, hope you can help <img src="http://brianburridge.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>I am using OpenReport as my front end to display jasper report, all the reports are done in ireport, it works fine, the Open report is really helpful and works nicely. But now I need to add a search function into the report, and there is no way I can have a input field in the report, so I am thinking to run the report inside the open report, keep the menus on top of the open report page and display the report inside the main frame of the open report, this way, I can simply add a search menu, then any time, user can bring in the search screen and do a search. I know how to make the html report inline, but I don&#8217;t know how to keep the header, the menu bar, that contains &#8220;Report&#8221; &#8220;Administration&#8221;, etc.</p>
<p>Do you think it is possible to do it? if yes, could you please give me some instruction?</p>
<p>Thank you very much!</p>
<p>Meiren</p>

<p>It sounds reasonable, but its hard for me to offer much advice at this point. I haven&#8217;t used Open Reports in a few years now. I would think you could us AJAX to load an HTML report into a layer and then use a JavaScript search function to search through the contents of that layer. Good luck!</p>

<p>I created report using birt report designer it displays it in preview properly, when i integrate it with openreports and try to generate report it give error in .rptdesign.</p>
<p>I think i dont have error in .rptdesign bcoz if i change version number in .rptdesign it shows report upto the point where i used crosstab(new feature from birt 2.2).</p>
<p>I downloaded latest openreports version, i read that this supports birt 2.2.</p>

<p>thanks for the very informative article. This and other finds has led me to go for the same solution. However, as a noobie, am finding it really difficult to find a simple start to finish step by step guide to installing openreports with jasperreports on Leopard? I posted the question on a couple of forums including (<a href="http://www.jasperforge.org/index.php?option=com_joomlaboard&#038;Itemid=215&#038;func=view&#038;catid=8&#038;id=42002#42002" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-comment','http://www.jasperforge.org']);" rel="nofollow">http://www.jasperforge.org/index.php?option=com_joomlaboard&#038;Itemid=215&#038;func=view&#038;catid=8&#038;id=42002#42002</a>)<br />
, but perhaps if you have a couple of minutes, just give me a few pointers. thanks</p>

<p>Thanks for your ongoing support. I have couple of issues working woth jasper reports and hopefully I&#8217;ll find an answer here.</p>
<p>I have a requirement to create barcode labels of 4&#8242; width and 2&#8242; height. I created a report in jasper with the help of iReport. If I generate the report in pdf and print it from pdfviewer then it prints fine on the datamax label printer. But, if I try to print it from jsp by displaying a print dialogue it prints 4 extra labels first and prints data on the fifth one. I am assuming that it&#8217;s taking A4 paper size in account. So, I have set Printrequestattributeset parms as below with no luck.</p>
<p>javax.print.attribute.PrintRequestAttributeSet printRequestAttributeSet = new javax.print.attribute.HashPrintRequestAttributeSet();<br />
printRequestAttributeSet.add(new javax.print.attribute.standard.MediaPrintableArea(0,0,jasperPrint.getPageWidth()/72,jasperPrint.getPageHeight()/72,javax.print.attribute.standard.MediaPrintableArea.INCH ));</p>
<p>exporter = new JRPrintServiceExporter();<br />
exporter.setParameter(JRPrintServiceExporterParameter.PRINT_REQUEST_ATTRIBUTE_SET, printRequestAttributeSet);<br />
exporter.setParameter(JRExporterParameter.JASPER_PRINT, jasperPrint);<br />
exporter.setParameter(JRPrintServiceExporterParameter.DISPLAY_PAGE_DIALOG, Boolean.FALSE);<br />
exporter.setParameter(JRPrintServiceExporterParameter.DISPLAY_PRINT_DIALOG, Boolean.TRUE);</p>
<p>2. I have to display the print dialougue to Client and get the input from the user and print to that particular printer. But, with above code it displays the print dialogue on server computer.Is there a way to show it on client side? As this is label printing client will be printing 50 to 100 labels at a time and they just want to click on a button and select a printer. They don&#8217;t want to see how the output looks.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help,<br />
Sammy</p>

<p>I think the way that cross tab works with multi-columns is: It builds like a hierarchy of columns. I want a little different implementation. Lets say for example I have an ArrayList of all the accounts in a bank. Each Account object has the following fields: holderName(String), amountInSavingsAccount (int) and amountInCheckingAccoun(int). I would want to loop through list using a Crosstab in the following fashion:</p>
<p>____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Checking Amount Savings Amount</p>
<p>____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>John 10 20<br />
Jack 10 20<br />
Dave 10 20<br />
Jamie 10 20</p>
<p>Jamie 40 80</p>
<p>____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>The problem is, with multiple unrelated columns in an object, Im not sure how to configure them in a crosstab in iReports. Any suggestions/inputs?</p>
<p>In short, what Im asking is Is there a way to have multiple non-nested columns using Crosstab?</p>
<p>Thanks in anticipation,</p>
<p>Andy.</p>

<p>In your post you commented:</p>
<p>I have made some improvements to OpenReports, including the Collection/List functionality to use Business Objects which JasperReports supports, but OpenReports currently doesnt. At some point Ill pass that code on to the original developers.?</p>
<p>Ive tried to upload a jasper file to OpenReports with JavaBeans as data source (it works perfectly in iReport), but it seams OpenReports cant handle that kind of data sources because I only got null? as ouput in my fields.</p>
<p>Do you still have those code improvements? Or can you pinpoint me where to look, read or improve myself.</p>

The thing is that the tomcat intalled as a service has diff options configured than the other tomcat.<br />
So, for being able to show the print dialog just execute the tomcat6w file in bin folder and go to Log On tab. There you have to check the Allow service to interact with desktop? since jasper is showing the print dialog as a separete dialog</p>

<p>We are using openreports which we plan to integrate with an application. Is there a way to suppress the open reports login, since we have an oblix login for the application itself.</p>
<p>Secondly, is there a way to hide some of the reports from the user?</p>

I want to create a Jasper report containing questions and responses for a Paper Object. Clearly I have a List of Paper objects containing part attribute and each Paper object internally has a List of Questions. Also each Question has a List of Responses.</p>
<p>I could create the main report with Paper object which displays different part names. But I want to display the questions associated with the part and responses associated with each question.</p>
<p>My Model classes will be:<br />
// Paper<br />
public class Paper{</p>
<p>public String partName;</p>
<p>public List questions;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>// Question<br />
public class Question{</p>
<p>public String question;</p>
<p>public List answers;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>// Answer<br />
public class Answer{</p>
<p>public String answer; }</p>
<p>I know I have to use subreport in ireport but somebody explain me how to set the datasource and loop the list in subreport?<br />
Thanks in advance.</p>

i want to remove all the querys from jasperreports and provide all the data needed using my domain object previusly retrieved using hibernate as the dataaccess layer.<br />

We are using OpenReports for reporting purposes. We are using this for last 3 years but never faced such issue. While going into Administration -&gt; Reports it give a &#8220;page can&#8217;t be displayed error&#8221;. On digging into the logs etc we found that listReports.action is not reponding in the configured time i.e 3 minutes. the same query runs fine in the sql developer and with in few seconds. Please refer the attached log details below. We are not able to find the root cause of the issue. Your help is highly appericiated on this issue. Thanks<br />
